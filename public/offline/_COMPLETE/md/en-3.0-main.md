## Important Note

Regardless of what you have read previously, read every word with humility.

Compare the words to your real life experiences. Challenge them. You can use no formula or list of steps to become free, but instead must seek understanding, and find it within yourself.

**The goal should be to seek truth.**

Do not believe the words that follow in this book. Instead, search for the truth within them.

Blind belief does not encourage freedom. Because belief is subjective. Truth is universal. To attain truth, you must seek it.

**It is important that you change your focus from methods and guides to understanding truth.**

With that said, my heart goes out to all of you.

I hope this book will change your life.

# Chapter 1. Introduction.md
Hey there, welcome the ppmo book. Through whatever way you found yourself here, maybe a recommendation, random link or any other method, I am happy you have made it here.

This book details the practice of leaving pornography and masturbation in favor of benefits - it is a guide to help you gain control over your life and to realize your potential. There is so much potential within yourself that can be unlocked once porn and masturbation are left, and with every cell in my body, I wish for you to complete this text, as I truly believe that it will change your life.

One understanding I want you to have is that you need to approach this in a way of understanding. This book is no how-to. Even though this is a 'guide', you should come to this as a way of understanding, not blind belief. I want you to make an understanding within yourself so that you can make your own decisions.

Also, before we get started, you should understand this: **DO NOT skip chapters.** This book has been crafted to help you quit without friction. If you miss critical information, you only have yourself to blame for any failures, so read everything as attentively as possible.

> Just for context, within this book, all instances of "nofap" are not referring to the NoFap subreddit or website but the practice of no-PMO/MO*. We do not condone spam of NoFap communities.

**PMO Definition: `Porn, Masturbation & Orgasm`** - When used in writing, PMO can also refer to fapping on its own (MO).

**User Definition: `Somebody that uses porn or masturbates.`**

## The Sad World Of Nofap
You might have heard of "nofap" before, but if you have not, most people hear about it in a similar way. Through a YouTube video that popped up as a suggestion, a link a friend sent us, or even a meme. If you have been linked this book, you must have been intregued to see what lies within. However, for those of you that have already heard of "nofap" you will likely know the sad truth around the "community".

> Every intelligent person knows that stimulation in excess, through alcoholic drink and narcotics, is a form of intemperance which destroys the vital organs of the body, including the brain. Not every person knows, however, that over indulgence in sex expression may become a habit as destructive and as detrimental to creative effort as narcotics or liquor.

Most people join the bandwagon of porn, as most people use it, so 'it must be fine', denouncing any evidence proving them wrong as they would rather be blissful in ignorance than living in truth. However, nothing can escape the fact that PMO has numerous adverse effects on the 'casual' user and 'heavy' user alike.

Negative effects span from low energy, low motivation, lessened ability to do work, lowered respect for women, depression, anxiety when interacting with others, porn-induced erectile dysfunction, relationship problems, acne, lowered testosterone (indirect), obsession with porn and fantasies, questioning sexuality despite no previous interest, and more. Many people believe nofap provides benefits, but it is actually just the negatives of fapping itself being removed.

These effects are not anecdotal and do not happen to a minority group. Instead, all users of porn suffer some degree of these symptoms, no matter if they realize it. Like the 'boiling frog', if a change occurs slowly and we are not knowledgeable, we are unlikely to notice it. Many problems in our personal lives could be directly or indirectly related to porn, yet we may be none the wiser. However, there is not much point in proving these negative effects (over again), as the neurochemical effects of porn are well understood. Just ask any ex-user that has been entirely freed from porn and masturbation. Unless they thought they would gain superpowers using nofap, the user would likely explain the positive changes they experienced after leaving.

So, let's return to the idea that we might have discovered nofap through a YouTube video. Hundreds of YouTubers have made videos on quitting porn and masturbation, with thousands of videos advising about quitting. However, there lies a sad truth between the lines that the average viewer is oblivious to - most advice given by these 'self-development' YouTubers/mentors has a meager success rate.

This is because people approach leaving PMO with a need for motivation. Some things can be broken with motivation, but havits/addictions cannot. Many "influencers" also use motivation as the primary cause for doing nofap. MOTIVATION IS TEMPORARY.

When you want to start something, often motivation is a good starting point, but motivation never leads to consistency. Nearly all popular advice uses motivation as the basis, which leads to the user having an incentive that quickly disappears, leading them right back into the trap. Sustainability comes from a genuine desire and intrinsic motivation to improve yourself. Therefore, motivation should not be used as a basis for leaving.

Think of most life problems. As humans, we can connect the dots and figure out a way to solve our problems. Some people are better at this than others, but all of us have some level of this ability. However, when it comes to addiction, our brain struggles to process it. It seems simple, just quit porn, right? Just explain all of the adverse effects of porn, the potential depression, the brain fog, the X, Y and Z. Yet, like most people starting nofap soon know, they realize how little control they have over themselves and their addiction.

The empty fulfillment that porn provides tricks the brain into an addiction, even knowing it is an illusion of experiencing sex. It is like one part of our brain knows we are fooling ourselves; the other part does not, like some sort of angel and devil on each shoulder. What once seems like a habit started through novel curiosity soon leads us into an addiction that causes us negatives.

Those who have tried and failed to quit porn or masturbation know the cycle. When we are about to decide to leave porn, we feel inspired, motivated, angry, excited, and have a wide range of emotions. As others have said, we are on the verge of getting "loads of benefits". But as time passes, our initial motivation runs out, and we become agitated. Soon enough, it seems like we lose control of ourselves and relapse. We relapse and fail despite our knowledge of negative effects, despite all our motivation at the beginning and every desire to leave. Unfortunately, most of those trying to quit PMO know this cycle too well.

Those who continuously fail may read the same book or strategy repeatedly without anything changing. My favorite quote that summarizes this well is from a villain in Far Cry 3. "The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result". I am not insinuating that you are insane, but doing the same thing so many times with the same result is pointless. If you repeat something often to no avail, you misunderstand or miss a truth. Keep this in mind.

Let's look at the bigger picture. In communities where empty motivation and basic strategies are used against addiction, how can you expect these 'strategies' to work? PMO is an addiction, not a habit, because most can't leave even if they have every desire to do so. Most of the people giving advice online are giving failing advice whether they know it or not, and these advisories keep pushing 'solutions' that do not work. If these people giving advice used the same strategies in a professional setting, they would be shut down immediately!

To solve addiction, you need an understanding of some key mental concepts to gain **control** and **power** over your reactions and fate. Without full control and understanding of how these components relate to each other, we can never expect to help people quit porn once and for all, in larger numbers.

Addiction to porn and masturbation is a battle between components of the mind. The internal struggle for control is fought so hard yet lost so frequently, leaving many feeling hopeless. The logical part of our brain (the pre-frontal cortex, which represents our true self the most) has the desire to leave the addiction once and for all. But little do we know that the primitive part of our brain (the amygdala) is the part of the brain that blindly wants addiction to continue - so we must have an understanding of our brain to become free.

But why is PMO most annoying? - This is because it is embarrassing to talk about. Due to human nature and shame, it is often kept under wraps, getting progressively worse over the years, trapping the user for the rest of their lives. It is hard to approach friends and family about it because it would seem weird and incredibly awkward. This is the part of it that is most likely the worse. Those with addictions to smoking, food, drugs, and other instant pleasures can approach others and relatively easily find professionals to fix their issues. Societies can criticize the people producing what causes the addiction, and then collective progress can be made. But due to the awkward nature of talking about porn, such a collective sentiment is likely never to happen.

**How do we overcome failing?**
To succeed in escaping from PMO, you need to have a fundamental paradigm shift in your mind. Your mental paradigm is your framework of concepts that dictate your outlook on the world and your abilities - this is a broader control of the mind through mindfulness and an understanding of neuroplasticity. The user that leaves the trap forever needs to understand these ideas.

"But why do some people quit without issue?"

We will touch on this more in the neuroplasticity section, but our initial success (if we do not learn the described concepts) is based on pure chance. Throughout our childhood, we make conclusions based upon events, and these fundamental concepts build who we are as a person. These concepts affect our ability to observe our reactions, affecting our ability to leave addictions. However, do not complain. The lessons you will learn to leave the addiction will be worth even more than just the initial benefit of leaving PMO.

## False Incentives
Be aware not to base your reasoning for quitting on any false incentives. Some of us may want to quit to appease our friends, make our partners happier, or become more disciplined. Even though these are great vessels to discover nofap, these incentives give the perfect excuse for us to relapse when we are in negative emotions.

- "I don't care what my friend thinks; it is not a big deal anyway."
- "She is already happy. It really is not that bad."
- "I can just do it less, and I can still be disciplined."
- "I will just do it rarely."
- "I will just watch the 'soft stuff'."

False incentives provide the ammo to fuel your brain's defense mechanisms. As a response to what our brains interpret as a threat, we have some key reactions. We dismiss opposing views and make illogical justifications and excuses for our actions. Defense mechanisms are what your brain uses when you are in a reactionary state, so instead of having a false incentive, you should have an incentive grounded in yourself.

Forget the initial incentive for being interested or wanting to quit. Make the understanding now (and continue to as you learn) that porn and masturbation has no benefit to us. We may think this statement to be untrue as we imagine what we receive as pleasure and the reward we get after using, but this is just another way that defense mechanisms have shown themselves.

**Porn is not valuable because it impairs your ability to think, find freedom, and function to your full potential.**

Do not quit for anybody else. Quit for yourself.

## Important Note About The Book
We do not drive a car on the highway without learning how to drive first. We do not fly a plane or do other activities that require knowledge to complete before learning how to first. Therefore, we must also not quit porn or masturbation before consciously deciding to
**You can continue watching porn/fapping while reading the book.**

This advice may seem counter-intuitive, but really, it is not. Until you finish, you have no inclination to stop.
You should not quit watching porn or masturbating until you finish this book.

**Also, you should not ask any questions about this book before completing. They will likely be answered in the book.**

## How To Finish This Book
Many will not finish this book. They will lose motivation, and will forever be a victim to the porn trap until the day they die. This one drop in desire will result in the continous decline in enjoyment of living, when the cycle continues further. If you do not want this, make reading this book a priority.

Your conscious intention to do something increases your brain's ability to wire in new ideas. I wish that with your conscious choice to learn the ideas expressed here, they will make a positive and valuable contribution to how you think, the actions you take, and the things you achieve.

If you want to read this book, without getting stuck in the middle or procrastinating, make it your highest priority to read this book within a week.

It should be your upmost priority to fufill this promise - then it shall be done.

# Chapter 2. Benefits.md
Leaving PMO provides many benefits and positives, as detailed in the introduction. These positives come from the changes in our neurochemistry and our ability to control our reactions to emotions. However, technically, leaving PMO has no positives - it is just the removal of negatives.

When someone stops having the flu, they do not think it has excellent benefits. Instead, they understand that it is an end of negatives - the flu was the cause of the grievance - you would not purposely get the flu to feel the relief of it leaving yet again. PMO is the same way. We do not notice this, as the changes are slow and gradual, but porn has ever-increasing adverse and unproductive effects on our lives, as dopamine desensitization requires us to up our usage and compulsion. Therefore, we can expect tremendous changes and improvements in our lives and outlook when leaving these negatives.

Do not make the mistake of normalizing masturbation. Because we have done it for so long, we find it hard to relate to when we didn't, and most used language to suggest benefits or that leaving PMO is not the normal. While in a societal sense, it may be the 'norm', in a bodily sense, it is not natural. Naturally, nobody has urges to watch lewd video clips as a reaction to emotion. Nobody tries to escape anxiety and fear by tricking our bodies into connections to partners we will never know. Porn is not natural and never will be. Masturbation too, has been around for a while, but on its own, it still drains your energy, and is just another outlet for hypersexualization.

Therefore make this key understanding - **The benefits of nofap are not direct benefits, but are just the end of negatives.**

## Neurochemical Changes Through PMO And MO
Any doubt of the negatives comes from the nature of addiction. It happens slowly. If, in one day, you went back to what you felt like before you started, the difference would be more apparent. - this is the 'boiling frog' analogy.

One of the most prevalent problems that porn creates is anxiety. The misdirection of sexual energy also causes a lack of confidence, and testosterone is lowered indirectly through self neglect (part of dopamine desensatization). It also makes you less incentivized to be social (through dopamine culling), which in turn amounts to anxiety.

Another reason that porn is unproductive comes from dopamine desensitization. When we receive abnormal amounts of dopamine, our bodies remove receptors to account for the unusual levels. This seems fine. However, it affects all other activities, not just porn.

Dopamine desensitization lowers your incentive to do life's tasks that seem less attractive. In a less negative example, this may cause a porn user to want to read fewer books, watch more mundane content, play more games, go outside less, not work out etc. In a terrible example, it may cause a user to do vital things less, such as eating, taking care of personal health, making efforts with friends, etc.

The interesting thing about dopamine is that most believe dopamine to be a pleasure chemical, **but it is not.** Dopamine is simply an anticipation chemical. It is the thing that provides reason to do things. This is why, sometimes, you are against doing something, but when somebody forces you to do it, you enjoy it. Even through dopamine desensitization, the "reward" (opioids) stays the same; it is only the anticipation and desire that change.

Dopamine desensitization has unmeasurable but damaging effects. It can cause life to be less fulfilling and less meaningful. When the small things in life are not incentivized or done happily, life becomes much more dull and mundane. This happens over time but is one of the saddest effects of porn.

When the dopamine receptors start to become regulated again, it makes activities that previously could have been boring (such as reading a book) more enjoyable/easy to do.

A frequent skydiver can feel anhedonia (the inability to experience pleasure) for the rest of their life. This is the same for a porn user or a cocaine user because these are all high dopamine activities.

Thus, the pursuit of intense pleasure (hedonism) ironically leads to its loss (anhedonia). Your brain is desensitized to life's natural highs – talking, smiling, learning, working, nature, exercise, etc, don’t feel “high” like they should.

It’s like your life is in grayscale instead of color; unfortunately, you don’t realize it - this is why quitting feels can feel amazing. Your brain’s dopamine receptors will heal and reverse their desensitization.

Increased brain fog is another effect that porn creates. Porn lowers brain chemicals (acetylcholine) vital in cognitive functioning. This can make active users feel like they are less able to function actively than before (however, not many people realize this because this happens slowly). In my personal experience, it felt like being fully awake but half asleep. From personal experience, it makes you as interesting as a blank piece of paper.

Another negative porn creates is depressive symptoms. Alternations and malfunctions in the dopaminergic (dopamine) system have been shown to happen more in cases of depressive disorders. Removal from PMO viewing regulates these malfunctioning pathways.

Another negative porn creates is porn-induced erectile dysfunction. A lot of you will not have this experience. Still, porn has been proven to be a causing factor in erectile dysfunction, making it difficult for partners to have sex because of the inability to perform. This is caused through the desensitization to real-life stimuli and the reliance on high-speed browsing and instant access to thousands of "partners".

The points talked about above are mainly specific to porn itself. It should also be understood that masturbation triggers the same pathways that porn does, and for people that want to leave porn but still want to masturbate, it activates the same neural pathways that lead to porn use, so it should be treated the same. All effects of masturbation are compounded by porn.

The main negative of masturbation (and porn on top) is that it drains your energy. It takes your body a lot of resources to create sperm, and when it is released regularly, the body has to compensate for the lack of resources and uses energy to do so. In a sense, it is your "life energy", and you trade part of your own life to create another. The issue with this is that for people that masturbate regularly, they have less energy in general. Effects can mean that users often feel sleepy, cannot sleep below 8-9 hours a night without feeling bad, look like they had a bad night of sleep even though they slept enough hours, and productivity is harder to do.

Another negative of masturbation and porn is that it is a giant waste of time. The amount of time spent seeking and searching for the perfect clip and masturbating itself takes considerable time, meaning that sleep may be sacrificed, or other activities may be put off. When people stop using PMO, they are often shocked at how much time they have, and that is also why they should change their lifestyle so that PMO has no place.

There are also more anecdotal (but consistently shown) negatives to PMO. PMO can create more acne and spots, it can lessen hair growth (and can cause it to recede), it can cause users to become gay or LGBT when they had no previous interest (just through hypersexualization), increased objectification of the other sex, less self-control, and more. People that have left have shown consistent improvements across these things.

However, I want you to understand that no matter how many negatives of porn (or positives of leaving) that you know of, no matter how many studies you research, no matter how many books you read, no matter how many conversations you have about why porn is bad, **it will not help you in leaving.**

In the case of porn, this fundamental delusion and brainwashing must be addressed, and you must come to an understanding about the nature of PMO and addiction to be set free. People that do "porn diets" or challenges will never be free. Freedom only comes from truth.

Freedom is what you are really searching for. Freedom to do things and freedom from things. When such prescriptions as "porn diets" are handed out, they will never provide freedom because they are prescriptions, not cures.

Another element of PMO to be considered is our reasoning for doing it. We think it "feels good", which is why most people say they do it. But in actuality, it is temporary freedom from the negatives. Yes, there is an increase in opioids on orgasm, but it acts as a temporary peace. It goes away, so users come back again and again, trying to see the same glimpse of peace and freedom from their problems - but they again come back to the real world. Only if they knew could they be set free from such a cycle that they would attain true peace - because porn created the disturbance in the first place.

We also would not care about PMO if there was no dopamine incentive to act. Also, do not ignore that the "reward" in PMO is much less than with a loving and sincere partner you value.

Porn presents itself wrapped up like a gift. Therefore, you must have the humility and sincerity to challenge your previous views, understandings and beliefs.

## Intro To Brainwashing
Brainwashing seems like a strong word, but once you realize the scope of PMO and how much it is promoted, you will understand that the word is appropriate.

Understanding brainwashing requires us first to examine the powerful effects of the supernormal stimulus. Our brains are simply not prepared for the existence of an 'online harem', allowing us to flick through more potential mates in fifteen minutes than our ancestors had in several lifetimes.

There's been much misguided advice and scare tactics in the past (like the saying that masturbation will make you blind) that really overdid it. Misconceptions like these were right to be ignored, but in the process, the baby has been thrown out with the bath water. From our earliest years, our subconscious minds have been bombarded by sexual messages and imagery in all media types, loaded with innuendo. At its core, the fundamental message implied is that "sex and sexual gratification is the most precious thing on this earth". It may seem ridiculous but think about the end of most films or TV shows. Think about the popular hip-hop and rap videos of our time. Think about the advertisements and society as a whole. They perpetuate this idea that bodily gratification is the most important desire you should hold instead of sincere love. This impact does not register in our conscious minds, but our subconscious mind absorbs it and builds pathways based upon it.

## Scientific Reasoning
There is a whole host of publicity in the other direction, supporting the fact that using porn and masturbation has detrimental effects on your health and wellbeing. There are detailed and reviewed studies on the effects of porn (such as YourBrainOnPorn) and other internet subcultures. However, these are not enough to rid the mind of the brainwashing and are never enough reasoning to make the user quit.

**This is because your brain does not care about negatives when it is in a reactionary state; it reacts to emotions through the pathways you have used the most.**

You would think that it would be easy to quit with the knowledge of all the negatives that PMO provides, including depression, anxiety, PIED, and others. But then, thinking about it, for other aspects of our lives, just knowing the negatives of an action is not enough to quit. Many of us consume high-sugar foods and unhealthy foods in full knowledge of their destructive nature. A lot of us use alcohol or drugs and perform other harmful activities in full knowledge of how bad they are. **The reason we keep using in the knowledge of negatives is a lack of mental control of emotions.**

# Chapter 3. Ownership.md
To be able to leave porn and masturbation, you must first acknowledge it as a problem. Even if the negative effects are not apparent, they happen slowly over time. You must understand that PMO is an addiction and not a habit.

You can break habits with enough will and desire. Think about it - if you have a habit of eating junk food with enough intrinsic motivation, you can easily get into healthier eating habits. A habit is precisely this - something you do that is very regular and hard to get out of, but you can if you have the desire.

On the other hand, there are addictions. Addictions present themselves as habits because they are on the surface level. However, the key difference with an addiction is that you cannot leave an addiction through motivation, willpower or knowledge of the negatives. Addiction is when you cannot leave an occurrence, even if you have every reason to as if you have no control over yourself. This is a key distinction because we cannot apply the same logic used for leaving habits to leaving addictions.

You can cut down on how much you use habits, but not how much you use PMO - otherwise, you are effectively edging by taking breaks and fueling your addiction further without knowing.

**Common misconception**
There is a common misconception regarding your part in still being a user. While you are not responsible for getting into the trap, you need to take accountability for continuing to decide to remain in the trap. You may try to push off this responsibility to the ones that introduced you to the trap, but take full ownership, to in turn, take full control.

Also, do not make the excuse of calling yourself an *addict*. Even if you are addicted, calling yourself an *addict* creates a subconscious belief that it cannot be changed because you are inherently an "addict". Do not make the mistake of trying to diagnose yourself by avoiding responsibility. You can change being addicted, but calling yourself an addict is limiting. Take accountability and take control.

## Extreme Ownership
To fix a problem, you first must take ownership of it, and we must apply this logic to PMO addiction. Most of us could pass the blame to many other people - the 'harem' sites that promote the content to us at young ages; the person that recommended we watch porn; the people that made PMO seem like the norm are all valid examples.

Even if we have valid reasons to attribute our problem to the people that caused it if we do so, it means that we remove our personal responsibility for fixing the problem, and it means no progress can be made.

Therefore you need to take **extreme ownership** of the addiction. You need to take all the responsibility onto yourself and hold yourself accountable, even if the problem is not your fault. Doing this will allow you to find a solution to the problem. By taking ownership, you accept the responsibility to fix the problem rather than waiting for somebody else to fix it.

It is easy to hate the people that produce pornography content, and it is easy to hate the women or men that participate in the content. However, hate will never provide the solution to your addiction. Yes, we should hold them accountable, but do not direct your anger and hate towards those that fueled your addiction - instead, funnel anger towards your negative mental schemas and pathways that continue to pedal addiction to PMO.

## Over Intellectualization
For some, they believe that logic and being an "intellectual" alone can bring them to a path of truth and freedom from problems. However, trying to use "intellectualism" alone is unlikely to bring you to the truth.

Nobody became a user through a logical or intellectual decision. They become a user through emotion, and what we percieve as pleasure. But as that pleasure fades into an ever-spiralling chase for freedom from the crutch, we start to grasp what is actually pleasurable.

# Chapter 4. Desire.md
**Transmutation Definition - `The process of turning one state of mind or energy into another, either positive or negative.`**

Any success in life comes from a desire - a seed in the mind that grows in proportion to the belief of the one desiring it. A desire is different from a dream, wish, or want because a desire is something that can be realized into reality if the desire is strong enough.

If what you wish to do is right and you believe in doing it, go ahead and do it. Dreams are not realized through hopes or wishes. Dreams become a reality through a pulsating desire, a definite goal of what you really want.

In relation to nofap, this is an important aspect. Without a definite goal, without a definite *desire* to leave, you may want to go half-in, half-out, but you cannot leave an addiction without understanding what your true self/being wants.

Our primal self (the reactionary part of our mind) and our true self (the logical and observational) want different things. A critical acknowledgment is that our reactionary and primitive part of the brain does not reflect our true selves. Concerning desire, the part of your mind where a burning desire comes from is your true/higher self. Make the distinction between desires you really want through life goals and dreams and the desires from bodily needs or reactions because the former is what you really want to chase.

A keen pulsating desire in one's mind (with the hope that it will become a reality) is transformed soon enough into the physical equivalent. Your outside world and experience directly result from the inside of your mind. Having a desire, rather than a wish, toward a goal previously thought to be unreachable will still give a much higher chance of obtaining that goal than before.

Do not make the mistake of thinking that most people have these desires. They have wishes and dreams (they still call them desires), but really, they do not have the belief that they can obtain those wishes. This means that they unknowingly limit their ability to get those desires, and unless they purposefully acknowledge and believe in their desires, they are unlikely to reach them.

The brain has the incredible ability to make significant adjustments and changes when large discoveries are made. This is called neuroplasticity, which we will dig into later and is very important. When the inside of our mind believes that the desire will become a reality, to the point where you carry yourself like you already have obtained it, then soon this desire will form into reality.

Some call this the "law of attraction", however, in my eyes, the law of attraction is only an appealing cover for the psychology of desire and how understanding brain function can lead to success. We can do things previously thought impossible, but you must also have some level of rationale in your optimism (some "law of attraction" preachers say that you can grow back limbs when impossible). However, do not mistake the fact that what you think is a rational goal is limited to your own previous beliefs.

**Desire and belief even has the ability to keep you alive. Patients in hospitals who have a burning desire to live have a much higher survival rate than those who don't, simply because of the desire and belief that they will live.**

With leaving porn and masturbation, you need to have a desire to be able to leave the trap. There are probably many emotions in your mind in reaction to the reality that you will stop PMO after completing this book, but any negatives result from your **emotional and reactionary self**. Have the desire to improve your life and to rid it of an unneeded poison that has no benefit. Observe that any negative emotions surrounding leaving are your defense mechanisms, not your true higher being and consciousness.

## Belief/Faith
Belief/faith is the lead chemist of the mind. The emotions of faith, love and sex are the most powerful of all the primary positive emotions. Love and faith are psychic; related to the spiritual side of man. Sex is purely biological and related only to the physical. The mixing, or blending, of these three emotions has the effect of opening a direct line of communication between the finite, thinking mind of man and infinite intelligence.

**What is faith?**
Faith is a state of mind which may be induced or created by affirmation or repeated instructions to the subconscious mind. Faith is a state of mind that you may develop at will after you have an understanding of its principles. It is the key to bringing desires into their physical equivalent, transmuting thought into the material.

*Repetition of affirmation of orders to your subconscious mind is the only known method of voluntary development of the emotion of faith.*

When you have the desire to transmute a desire into its physical counterpart, you need the component of faith for it to reach the physical form. You can create faith by convincing the subconscious mind that you believe you will receive your desire, and it will act upon that belief, which your subconscious mind passes back to you in the form of faith. Convincing the subconscious mind is called auto-suggestion (more about that soon).

Any impulse of thought repeatedly passed onto the subconscious mind is, finally, accepted and acted upon by the subconscious mind, which proceeds to translate that impulse into its physical equivalent by the most practical method available. When understood, this statement has a profound and powerful meaning, so I recommend you re-read it if you do not understand it.

*All thoughts that have been emotionalized (given feeling) and mixed with faith begin the process of translation into their physical equivalent or counterpart.*

So again, how does this relate to leaving porn and masturbation? Its relevance comes from the state of mind it brings, and the ability to transform desires into their physical forms. As we have said before, you must have a desire to leave, and then you must have hope and belief in that desire, carrying yourself as you have already obtained the desire.

Those who have failed nofap in the past may feel it is hard to have hope or believe in their desires. This makes sense in their position, as in the past, they have gone through the struggles of convincing themselves that they are free while falling right back into the same trap later. It feels hard for somebody that has failed to have faith in the desire to leave forever because they feel like they cannot trust themselves, and they feel like they will run down the same path again. However, understand that you will truly be set free through an understanding of the mind. That is all addiction is. A neurological process.

Do not mope, and do not lose faith in your desire due to any previous failures. Make the understanding that any previous failures were either a failure to remove brainwashing or a failure to understand how to react to emotions. When you can control your reactions, you can obtain a true position of power and control.

The subconscious mind will translate into its physical equivalent, a thought impulse of a negative or destructive nature, just as readily as it will act upon thoughts of a positive or constructive nature. Those with negative thought impulses are often the creators of their misfortunes because of the negative beliefs, which are picked up by the subconscious mind, and translated into the physical equivalent.

**A reminder: You may benefit by passing on to your subconscious mind a desire which you wish translated into its physical equivalent, in a state of expectancy or belief that the transmutation will actually take place.**

### Auto-Suggestion
*Through the dominating thoughts that one permits to remain in the conscious mind (whether these thoughts are negative or positive), the principle of auto-suggestion voluntarily reaches the subconscious mind and influences it with these thoughts.*

To obtain success, you first need a desire based on intrinsic motivation (motivation within yourself) and not any temporary motivation. You also need faith to bring that idea into its physical equivalent, but how do you acquire faith? It is done through auto-suggestion. The concept of auto-suggestion is well known yet not well understood. It is the vessel of communication between the conscious and subconscious mind, allowing the ability to pass a thought that holds emotion and to receive back in return a faith that it will come true.

Auto-suggestion is the repeated affirmation of thought to the subconscious (with emotion backing the thoughts). The mere reading of words has no consequence unless you mix meaning or emotion with your words. The emotion can be both positive or negative; in turn, auto-suggestion can return a positive or negative belief. Without knowing it, we can turn negative thoughts into their physical equivilant with auto-suggestion. However, we can use this method and knowledge for positive suggestions.

## The Sinister Trap
The trap comes in two parts. There is porn, and there is masturbation. Porn is what most people talk about as being bad. However, both porn and masturbation are negative sums, and they are so intertwined that, most of the time, you cannot leave one without leaving the other. And even if you can use masturbation on its own without porn, there is no point to it because you can instead use that energy for sexual transmutation into other activities.

**Hypersexualization Definition `The hyperactive oversexualization that comes from porn and fast-speed innuendo`**

> The problem is not to do with your character. The problem is communicating with human nature.

Porn and hypersexualization influence us from a young age. Most of us hear about porn / sexual content through social media on a recurring basis. This constant referring to these 'normal' activities makes the non-user have a novel curiosity about what everyone is talking about, which will inevitably lead them to become a user.

Internet porn works through hijacking natural reward mechanisms designed to keep you reproducing for as long as possible. Porn's instant and highly accessible form keep the brain's reward mechanism producing dopamine significantly longer than naturally possible. Scientifically, this is called the Coolidge effect, which you might already have heard of. This effect is present in many animals, but in nature, after having real sex with a partner, you are satisfied and satiated. However, with internet porn's nature, you can browse through millions of online 'partners', meaning that your brain goes into overload, overloading your natural limiter.

Dopamine is the neurotransmitter associated with feelings of wanting/seeking, with the actual feeling of pleasure produced by opioids. Dopamine is what makes you want to do something. Dopamine makes you want to start an activity in search of its potential reward.

Dopamine is also released in response to novelty. With a seemingly infinite amount of porn available, this floods the limbic system (mental reward circuit), so the first time you see porn, you act and masturbate, triggering another flood of opioids. Incentivized to get what your brain thinks is a reward again, it saves this mental pathway (like a script) for easy recall, and it strengthens these neural pathways every time you use it again through a chemical called DeltaFosB. Every time you use porn, it becomes even more automatic because your brain strengthens the mental pathways to using, becoming a self-feeding cycle.

You may think that hyper-increased dopamine makes you feel better, but that is misunderstanding how dopamine works. You could compare it to putting 10,000 volts through a machine that works perfectly fine at 240 volts. You don't get enhanced performance, you merely cook the machine.

The dopamine is not what we are truly looking for. What we are looking for is true joy. A sense of happiness without it being in the future. Yet most do not make this realization about what will lead to them being truly satisfied.

**Pangs Definition - `Reminders to watch porn or to masturbate by the brain`**

A fleeting sense of security is all that's needed to get through a rough spot in life, but will your desensatized brain be able to catch that drop of destresser that a non-user's brain is able to use? Dopamine flooding acts like a quick-acting drug, falling quickly and inducing withdrawal pangs. Many illusioned users think these 'pangs' are adverse effects when trying or being forced to stop. However, these thoughts are mental because they are deprived of their 'pleasure'; in reality, these 'pangs' are just the remaining effects of the neural pathways left from porn.

The actual chemical withdrawl from PMO is so subtle that it is mostly undetectable. There is no physical pain, and the only bodily thing you feel is the feeling that something seems missing. This happens because you replaced your time that was previously mundane tasks and porn. However, after leaving PMO, it feels like you have so much more time because once, you may have just filled in This dopamine isn't what your looking for. What your looking for is true joy.your time with PMO rather than your actual interests, making you less engaging. "Boredom" is not a negative, however, and we will talk more about boredom later - put some thought into what you enjoy doing and what your responsibilities are, and you can put your time into those things that truly benefit you as a whole, rather than mundane activities that only reward with dopamine. Find what truly benefits you. (By the way, we will go more into emotions and reactions in the next few chapters).

Another important note is the actual nature of why you use PMO repeatedly. You know the feeling when a random car in the street has been beeping all day - or some other minor persistent aggravation - then it suddenly stops, and marvelous feelings of peace and tranquility wash over you? This is not really peace, but just the end of aggravation. PMO is the same as this. People perceive porn and fapping as 'relaxing' and use it when anxious or sad because they believe it will help. However, porn provides no relaxation. It only temporarily removes the nudges to have another session until enough time passes for your body to believe you require dopamine again. You can also use these times of reminder for positive reinforcement, which we will talk about later, but it is basically the thought that you no longer have to follow the nudges for such an empty 'pleasure', which I understand to be not beneficial.

After having a session and waiting for some days, we start having withdrawl 'pangs', which are not physical pain, just a mental nudge that we should PMO. As discussed earlier, these are repeated affirmations to the subconscious that PMO is beneficial, even if you know that porn and masturbation has no benefit to you and only has negatives. However, these small nudges to the subconscious eventually translate the thought into an impulse of its physical equivalent by the most practical method available. This shows the importance of recognizing these thoughts and emotions and entering an observational state rather than a reactionary state through introspection and meditation.

## The Dance Around The Red Line
Porn users constantly filter what they perceive to be acceptable and not acceptable when they watch the media. They focus on the parts of the content to which they are attracted the most, and they limit their curiosity to what they deem to be too weird or disgusting. Some users only try to watch the 'soft stuff' or limit themselves to a specific genre. They do this because they consciously or subconsciously fear the harmful effects of watching the 'forbidden' content. Even though they may illusion themselves into believing porn to be beneficial, some part of them still partly understands the reality.

If one day, the user could not get their usual type of pornography, and there was only the 'weird' or 'unsafe' genre, do you think they would stop having a session? No. The brain does not care what you fap to; it is the seek-and-search of novelty that fuels this. To begin with, if they only had the choice of 'unsafe' porn, they may be disgusted or unnerved, but only after a few sessions, it would become the standard. What once was a 'forbidden' genre or what once they would have found disgusting is now their new normal, and they feel like they are not satisfied without using that genre. This is just part of the effects of dopamine desensitization - the old content seems mundane compared to more engaging and 'daring' content, fueling the desensitization even more.

The reason why most users continue using is that although they may know the disadvantages outweigh the advantages, they still have the illusion that there is something in porn that we genuinely benefit from. We may enjoy relieving the withdrawal pangs that PMO creates, but as explained previously, this is just the end of aggravation rather than genuine peace. Surely it would feel so much nicer to skip this whole cycle and not to keep illusioning ourselves!

Porn and masturbation presents itself as a 'savior'. A solution for any bad day, a measure for any negative emotions or thoughts. This suggestion is the core of how PMO works. Masturbating is purely a response to emotion, nothing else, nothing more. If a lack of dopamine due to a break in usage creates negative emotion, and then you react to that negative emotion by using PMO, then you feed straight back into the trap - its circular, self-feeding nature. However, we have the power to stop this through the control and acknowledgment of our negative emotions.

## The Smoker's Analogy
A good analogy is that of the cigarette smoker. If they went ten hours of the day without a cigarette, they’d be tearing their hair out, but many smokers will buy a new car and refrain from smoking in it. Many will visit theatres, supermarkets, and churches and being unable to smoke causes them no problems. Even on trains and airplanes, there have been no riots.

Users will automatically refrain from using internet porn in their parents’ homes during family gatherings and other events with little discomfort. In fact, most users have extended periods during which they abstain without effort. The neurological little monster is easy to cope with even when you’re still addicted. Millions of users remain "casual users" all their lives and are just as addicted as more frequent users. There are even heavy users who've kicked the addiction but have an occasional peek, greasing the water slide to be ridden down at the next dip in mood.

The actual porn addiction isn’t the main issue, simply acting as a wall in keeping our minds confused over the real problem – brainwashing. Don’t think the bad effects of internet porn are exaggerated however, if anything, they’re sadly understated. Occasionally, rumors circulate that the neural pathways created are there for life, with the right mix of chance and stimulus sending you down the life-ruining water slide again, but these are untrue. Our brains and bodies are miraculous machines, recovering within a matter of weeks. It’s never too late to stop!

A quick browse of online communities will show you people of all ages rebooting their (and their partners) lives. As with anything humans do, some take it to the next level, practicing semen retention, 'Karezza' and through differentiation of the sensory and propagative sides of sex, make their partners happier and more fulfilled than ever before. It may be a consolation to lifelong and heavy users that it’s just as easy for them to stop as casual users. The further it drags you down, the greater the relief. You can find the process of leaving enjoyable in the knowledge that such a posion has been removed from your life.

## Casual Users
Casual users are a sad and pitiful example of somebody that most likely wants to leave the addiction. It is just that they are making excuses and are using other defense mechanisms to justify still being a user.

The 'casual user' is the person that says because of their infrequent PMO use or gravity towards 'softcore material', then it must be alright, and it is not a problem. However, the casual user is just as illusioned as the active user because they are still creating excuses to continue to use. Part of them understands that continuing to use PMO will have adverse effects, so they try to implement a half-measure, trying to keep the 'benefits' of porn while minimizing the 'negatives'. However, you can never remove the negatives unless you set yourself free.

While on the surface level, being a "casual user" may seem like a good idea, it has unintended effects. The first is making the conclusion that fapping has any 'benefit'. PMO creates negative effects, temporarily relieving them with every session, brainwashing us into believing there is an actual reason to use PMO. Is there a valid reason why leaving a non-essential and damaging task is not a good idea? Also, the second unintended consequence is the user effectively edging through the gaps between sessions. When the user cannot have a session, they loathe and build up excitement towards the next session, fueling the seek-and-search mechanism even more and adding to the addiction by giving a positive expectation to the detrimental action of using.

The simple answer for the 'casual user' is to stop completely - freedom from the cycle and liberty from their illusions. However, then they fear failure and fear leaving their crutch and "pleasure". But you have to understand that fear is the emotion that starts a relapse. Therefore, recognize that fear, and understand that these negative thoughts and schemas are the cause of all your suffering. By the way, do not misunderstand observation. Observation is not thinking about the emotion more, but it is a dissasociation from the negative schemas - they are not your true self.

## Watching Weird Content
Frequent porn creates the need to seek and search for more exciting and newer material. This cycle happens continuously throughout the life cycle of a PMO'er, and if they keep crossing this 'red line', the material they will have to use to get off will be a far cry from what they initially used. This is why things such as fetishes exist, because dopamine is released through seeking and searching, and the same clip won't satisfy.

For someone that just discovered PMO who stumbled across these clips, it is common for them to be disgusted. Yet, a few years later, they will require the same clips to have a session.

This is the nature of desensitization and seeking-and-searching, which can lead people to terrible places because they are forced to consume shocking and violent content to satisfy their pangs. It can cause people to question their sexuality or cause people to fantasize about violence; it can even cause people to fetishize minors or rape.

This seek-and-search across the 'red line' (if not stopped) ends on these roads. Yet, the 'average' user will not believe it could ever come to this. They are still attracted to the generic stuff, right?

There is a lack of accountability directed to porn use for these negatives, and it is common for people to become defensive at the thought that their number one activity has caused them to do these things.

However, freedom requires no seeking and searching. Freedom only requires understanding, and truth.

# Chapter 6. Neurology.md
## Neural Pathways And Addiction
The only way to leave an addiction is through understanding. You can read instructions/how-to's all you want, but they will only suppress usage rather than freeing you from it. A deep understanding of a problem is vital to become free from it.

For many things in life, we must find the answers within ourselves. Most people want a list of static instructions for everything because that is how they have been taught - not to be an individual. The problem is that how-to's and 'prescriptions' only work for mechanical things, such as how to ride a bike, mathematics, and other things that can have reproducible instructions and outcomes. How-to's are not beneficial for things that are experiential - problems that can only be lived through in an experiential/spiritual sense can only be removed through an understanding of the problem.

Within every problem lies the answer. This rule is inherent to every problem and is a universal law. In this way, it is wise to understand how a problem came to arise so it may be removed again. Within the realm of porn addiction and hypersexualization, you must fully understand not only the physical effects but aditionally how users wanting to leave still seem to struggle against best efforts.

Those who fail at becoming free lack a fundamental understanding of their addiction. These people often repeat the same "nofap" material over and over to no avail - this shows they are approaching the same way, with a lack of understanding of the true problem and the problem *of failing to leave the problem itself.*

The mind works in many complicated ways that are hard to explain through creative and logical works. However, a rule exists in every natural being - to take the path of least resistance. When we see a very long path next to a quick shortcut, we are most likely to take the shortcut. This is inherent to our survival, and it makes sense to be efficient and to perform at an optimal level. This ties into addiction because the path of least resistance is often what we **understand** to be the **most beneficial** path for us. Suppose we do not understand, and we blindly follow steps. In that case, we should not be surprised when an internal argument rises - we must have a deep understanding because otherwise, we will subconsciously believe what is harming us is the best course of action.

Inside our mind, these pathways are strengthened over time in coordination with what our mind perceives as best. A path not taken much is more challenging than one that has been trampled many times (making the way easier to travel). In this sense, it is easier to do things we have already done, and it is less easy to do newer things. These pathways are strengthened through a chemical called deltaFosB. This process makes pmo usage feel "automatic". Because these mental pathways have been taken so many times, they have become normalized.

However, there is hope. These pathways are not permanent - with an **understanding** that there is a more beneficial path and better options, we can understand there is no need to use such pathways.

Another component inside the mind is dopamine. Contrary to popular belief, dopamine is not a pleasure chemical. It is, instead, an anticipation chemical. That is why before a 'relapse' the user may feel excited, but after the dopamine goes away afterward, all anticipation goes away, and they make a realization that they failed themselves, and they receive a clarity that was previously blinded by dopamine.

Dopamine is not a bad thing. It is helpful to motivate us to begin things, and it is essential to keep ourselves regulated (such as eating, drinking, reading, etc). The problem is when the dopamine system becomes desensatized. When the anticipation chemical of dopamine is produced too much, the body has an inbuilt regulation system to cull dopamine receptors to remain regulated. On the surface, it seems like the body can heal itself, so there is no problem; however that is not the case.

During dopamine desensitization, the old high becomes the new standard, and the old standard becomes the new low. In basic terms - dopamine desensitization lowers anticipation for generic daily activities that aid your fulfillment and happiness. When a dopamine system is desensatized, these smaller dopamine rewards are less attractive, so users often leave their basic human needs neglected.

Every session causes your baseline level of these chemicals to be slightly lower than it was before, to compensate for the high levels of these chemicals that are now present as a result of your exposure to the supernormal stimulus.

The lack of incentive for these small life enjoyments leads to a feeling of emptiness - and everlasting desire that will never be filled because they are traveling the wrong way - they must become free from their crutch to want to do smaller enjoyments again.

This is why PMO'ers participate in time-wasting activities more and struggle/neglect to do things they may find less interesting. When a user leaves usage, they often observe the profound amount of time they have because they realize how much they have wasted before. That is why it is recommended to acknowledge things you love to do for fun/to relax that benefit you, and also to acknowledge things to do to be productive (and we will discuss this later). You do not have to be perfect. You should simply strive to be better.

Luckily, dopamine receptors can be resensitized, and people who have fried their brains can still recover. There is no time frame for this recovery. Curiosity questions like "how long will it take" and "have I recovered yet" are unproductive. Every day you will be better than yesterday, and nothing else matters.

## Self-Feeding Cycle Through Negative Thought Patterns
One of the least well-understood concepts among users is just how they get what they call "urges". "Urges" are caused through associations. 

Associations are links to stimuli that create a reminder to ride the neural pathway that has been traveled many times before. This stimulus can be anything, but it usually is suggestive material and negative emotions. Emotions such as fear and anxiety are mentally associated with PMO because of our subconscious beliefs (in delusion) that PMO will solve those feelings. Reality shows that PMO creates those feelings and makes existing ones harder to cope with.

People that want to leave build up an aura of fear around leaving. They fear failure and everything to do with porn and fapping. In their mind, they draw police lines around it and try to brainwash themselves to try to ignore PMO out of existence. However, suppression will NEVER work. What is beneficial is understanding addiction. They only would want to brainwash themselves because they do not believe leaving is beneficial; they think this because they do not understand their circumstance. You have no need to draw barriers around PMO and no need to fear it either.

It would be best to acknowledge the choice you have available. You are free to masturbate when you want, and you are free not to masturbate. You alone have the power to decide what you want. In this sense, you have not stopped fapping because it has some temporary motivation but because you truly understand it is more productive and beneficial to become free. It would help if you did not fear either side. We often underestimate our control.

Anxiety and fear both remind us of PMO because of association. This is not a bad thing. This is just the remainder of our neural pathways. Once we make this realization that every time we notice such a reaction, we can control it, it is truly liberating. More on this in the neuroplasticity chapter.

In general, fear feeds into PMO, and PMO creates more fear. Therefore, we should interrupt this cycle. This cycle can be interrupted by acknowledging when we have such emotions and also by removing the fear of failure and similar limitations.

One pain is knowing that you could be much better than you are now. That you could reach your most deep inner goals and that you could be set free from these temporary restrictions weighing over your life. But this is a good pain, a sign which you can take a positive from - once you discover new wisdom, your life automatically has requirements added to satisfy the new wisdom. So, don't take things out on yourself that you have not achieved these things - instead, strive to gain the knowledge that will provide such freedoms. Loathing and complaining will not benefit you and only stifles progress.

> Suppressing problems will not provide freedom. Only understanding the problem will. Freedom comes from understanding truth. And in being, the truth will lead to freedom.

## What About Stress?
Let’s define stress. In physical terms, stress happens when something wants to be in two places at one time. If I apply pressure to both ends of an iron beam, I stress the beam because one part wants to be north, and the other wants to be south.

**Stress is an inability to decide what’s important.** You want two incompatible things at once. I want to relax, but I need to work. Now I’m under stress.

When you accept that something’s out of your control, there’s no point in getting stressed about it. The mind constantly creates stress, making you more paranoid or angry than situations warrant.

You want to find peace _from_ mind. You aren’t turning off your brain. You can’t suppress the mind or force it to do anything. If I say, “Don’t think of a white elephant,” you’ll think of a white elephant. Instead, you want to develop tools so your mind can be peaceful on its own. Then, stress will go away naturally. 

Here’s a phrase I like: “Peace is happiness at rest; happiness is peace in motion.” Someone who’s peaceful at rest will end up happy when they do an activity. While a happy person sitting idle will be peaceful. The ultimate goal is not _happiness_, even though we use that term a lot. The goal is _peace_.

So the question becomes: How do you get to peace?

The first problem with attaining peace is that no activity will get you there. Fundamentally, peace is inactivity; it’s a sense that everything is fine.

If everything is fine, you’re not doing any physical or mental activity to change it. You’re also not wishing you were doing something to change it because that creates stress. If you want to attract peace, you simply have to aim toward it.

The happiness in leaving PMO should not be somewhere in the future. Peace comes when you have happiness at rest.

**You cannot work toward peace, only understanding.**

## The Importance Of Neuroplasticity
Many of us hold delusions impeded by society that we have picked up over time. This is to be expected - we all pick up so much information in the conscious and subconscious every day. Especially in this age of information, we have a stream of beliefs and desires that come at rates hard to process.

Due to all this information coming in so fast, our brains have learned to pick up this information but not look into it any deeper than surface level. This is where believing delusions come from. Many people hold radical beliefs, yet when questioned for authenticity, they shut down because they did not even process these ideas themselves.

This affects you and me because subconsciously, we have picked up flawed ideas, beliefs and understandings.

**Paradigm Shift Definition:** `A fundamental shift in core concepts, beliefs and structure`

One of the biggest mistruths is the belief that our mental status is static and that we have some sort of limitation to what we can achieve. Neuroplasticity preaches the complete opposite of this misunderstanding - that with a fundamentally new understanding and paradigm shift in a person, their mental abilities can benefit significantly.

# Chapter 7. Brainwashing.md
The brainwashing of PMO is the leading cause of failure for users that are trying to leave PMO once and for all but end up failing. Brainwashing is the engrained idea that porn provides any benefit. It is also the idea that you are entitled to sex or porn and that sex is the highest goal in your life.

It includes our upbringing in society, reinforced by the brainwashing of our own addiction and combined with the most powerful influences - our friends, relatives and colleagues. The phrase ’giving up’ is a classic example of brainwashing, implying genuine sacrifice. The beautiful truth is there’s nothing to give up; on the contrary, you are facing freedom.

Ironically, the most powerful force in this confusion is the user themselves. It’s a fallacy that users are weak-willed or physically weak people. You have to be physically strong to cope with addiction after you know it exists. Perhaps the most painful aspect is that they place themselves as unsuccessful losers and insufferable introverts. A friend could likely be more interesting in person if they hadn’t put themselves down for seeking self-pleasure.

**Pang Definition: `Reminder to have a session`** - A small reminder/notice that porn is 'available', which happens due to your previous lifestyle.

One aspect of brainwashing is stress. Porn has subconsciously registered in billions of people's brains as a 'method to relieve stress'. Users believe that it allows them to relax - to move away from their life's difficulties and that it benefits them. This belief, however, is interpreting everything backward.

Porn removes your ability to cope with stress by desensitizing your dopamine receptors. The process of dulling these receptors means that the little things in life which were previously enjoyable now seem like more effort compared to other, higher dopamine activities. If this process were immediate, it would make users realize the adverse effects that PMO is having on them. But, this is just like the parable of the boiling frog - that which happens slowly to somebody is not noticed until it has a drastic effect.

This reminds me of the "drugees" that hang around my town at night. They are content with living on the sidewalk, next to piles of trash and other loud and snarly addicts. They are okay with living this life not because they genuinely want to - but because the dopamine in the idea of sorting their life out is incomparable to the dopamine in the drugs they are taking. People will ignore their basic human needs for addiction, destroying many.

These kinds of people may say that the drugs 'relieve stress'; however almost every outsider can see that they are only stressed because of what the drugs have done to them. Nobody that is not in their situation is restless when they do not get their fix - they are instead fulfilled with the smaller events in life.

Porn creates stress by overstimulating your dopamine receptors. Users illude themselves into believing that it is required for relieving stress, even though before they became users, they had no need. And to 'relieve' the pressure, they use it again.

Our brain builds a response to emotions that trigger pangs. These emotions are fear, anxiety, and boredom. Fear (in a user's life) typically comes from everyday events that happen in life, such as fear of getting laid off, fear of failure or having a bad day. In these cases, porn is imagined as a "savior" at the end of the day that will make everything better - even though it will make everything harder to cope with. Anxiety and uncertainty are also emotions where a similar response happens. In response to not being able to work out how something will play out, this plagues our minds with negative thoughts. Pangs can occur in these moments because porn is interpreted as something that fixes negative emotions. Instead, it creates these negative emotions, worsening over time.

PMO is a constant state of anticipation, and then temporary clarity over and over again.

Porn has no benefit. Try to imagine a perceivable benefit of porn. Some say "it feels good", but this is only because it temporarily removes the stress it creates before the primitive brain asks for another fix. It would be much better to permanently remove the need to keep removing the stress. Another part of the "benefit" that some believe is the opioids that are released during PMO. This is a natural response that is made to encourage reproduction; however, users are fooling their bodies' responses. They stimulate themselves for lust, void of all love and bond, chasing the brief glimpse of peace. They disregard the significance of love (one of the universe's powerful elements) and the value of a sincere partner. They do not do this consciously, but then they try to avoid challenging this to protect what they perceive as their daily 'reward'.

So I will ask you again, is there any benefit to porn? Answer this question.

You would only believe that porn has ANY benefit due to brainwashing. Look into any possible "benefit" to porn you can come up with and pick it apart - It makes you "feel good"? How come that it increases your stress, and it only "feels good" because it temporarily removes the stress that it creates? Do you do it for "education"? Well, when is your graduation? Do you do it to cope with a breakup? Why 'cope' using something that increases your stress even more? Do you do it because you are bored? Is there not a much better use of time? Do you do it to relieve sexual urges? Why not transfer that energy into other facets of life? You can understand that many of these preconceived ideas are part of the brainwashing.

A lot of people look at porn in rose-tinted glasses except for the time of temporary clarity after using. When the dopamine is not sought after for that brief time, we have a sense of clarity away from all the anticipation.

## Entitlement And Culture
Through society's mistruths and delusions, many of us have developed a sort of entitlement around sexual pleasure. We believe we should be able to have a sexual release with or without a partner. This belief is toxic - we are entitled to nothing like this. Loving relationships must be earned through humility, sincerity and connection, rather than void, lustful desires.

The culture often places women/partners above every other reward out there. Rappers, social media influencers, and celebrities flaunt and advertise that sex is the 'nirvana'. They do not preach true love and humility - instead, they advertise a carnal bodily desire as the most important thing there is. This creates a sense of entitlement to pleasure.

Is empty fulfillment what you really want? Or is it freedom - freedom to do what you like but also (more importantly) release from your own mind - freedom from problems and struggles. Yet, most approach life trying to change external factors or chasing empty fulfillment in search of freedom - what is truly wanted is not found in this.

Addiction enables artificial relationships and activities. What events do you most look forward to? They may the ones where you get to drink or do drugs. You look forward to dinnertime, an upcoming party or bar-hopping with friends.

To see how artificial it is, resolve to abstain from drinking or doing drugs the next time you go out. Now ask yourself how much you’re looking forward to that event. You’ll find: not at all.

This creates a conundrum. These sources of artificial pleasure eventually will desensitize me, bring misery when they’re gone and lead to addiction. But if I give them up, I’ll also be miserable because I’ll no longer socialize with my friends. I won’t go out, and I won’t have fun.

Breaking addiction requires a new lifestyle. People struggle with breaking addiction because you have to break the physical addiction, and you also have to change your lifestyle. You have to switch to a lifestyle where you can be happy without that substance.

If I drink to be social and do that enough, I’ll find myself hanging out with people I wouldn’t spend time with otherwise. When I’m sober, I can’t tolerate these people, the topics we discuss or the venues we visit. I can only do it drunk.

Addiction holds together fake relationships and fake activities. While in PMO, there is less of a "public culture", this still holds true;  in the same sense, we realize how void PMO really is.

In this example, these fake relationships and fake activities are held together by alcohol. For example, If I stop drinking, I have to replace my friends and find new things to do; this is difficult and socially unacceptable. 

It is a problem to look forward to weekends and holidays. First, it takes the joy out of the everyday, because you’re living in the future and suffering the rest of the time. Second, you have accepted a way of life in which most of your time is spent suffering. This is also why PMO causes a lack of interest in life - because it always presents itself as better than whatever else you are doing - inferring all other time used is bad.

To become free, you have to let go of your current lifestyle and create one which removes such negative patterns.

## No Need To Lie
Some people feel like they have to somehow brainwash themselves into believing PMO is bad. They read material over and over, repeatedly trying to make themselves believe it is bad. However, this comes with the preconception that PMO is beneficial in any way.

We are not seeking mistruths here. If you seek mistruths, freedom can never come from that, as freedom only comes from truth.

There is no incentive to lie to ourselves. If porn was productive (in some alternate universe), then there would be no reason to avoid it. But as we understand, it is unproductive and only proves as a burden to users, who, without their knowledge, partake in the chase for temporary peace.

There is no reason to feel like we have to lie to ourselves because we do not need to believe any lies. The whole point of freedom is to find it through truth.

Our fundamental nature runs on what we understand to be beneficial and not beneficial. No matter how much we **want** to understand something, if we do not, subconsciously, we will have a dissonance between what we want to believe and what we actually believe, causing a half-torn feeling. Therefore we have no need to lie to ourselves about anything.

## Prescriptions
Prescriptions are another significant part of brainwashing. People everywhere claim to have a how-to guide to leaving bad patterns in a few days. All you need to do is "follow the instructions" in an easily replicable way. However - through all genuine struggles, most are unable to change, even after following these guides.

Not everybody seeks freedom. However, if you want it, prescriptions and how-to's will not give it to you. That is not to say prescriptions are either bad or good. Bad or good is another trap we fall into. How-to's are good for repeatable and mechanical activities. When a+b always equals c, prescriptions are not unproductive.

In any case, for things you experience, true freedom lies through understanding. This understanding only happens internally, resulting from a natural inclination and desire to find the truth. Freedom is internal, not external - and freedom is found in truth.

"The wise man does not try to stop the rain. The rain will always exist. The wise man, instead, carries an umbrella, so the rain has no effect."

You may also feel inclined to prescriptionize this book rather than using it to come to an understanding. Some move from guide to book to how-to reading every material under the sun to try to leave. They re-read guides ten times over, and some even message authors to try to create the perfect method, and they believe after this, they will be free. They believe that eventually, they will find the perfect method. But the truth is, in this way, they will never find freedom.

Freedom is found when you stop chasing. For such people, they have been so involved in chasing the perfect guide or strategy, that they do not realize that the chase has taken the front seat instead of having an understanding and finding the truth. Is the chase worth it? Prescriptions have taken the front seat in place of cures. Suppression has taken the front seat in place of freedom through understanding.

There is no reason to relive old habits or revisit old problems as things do not return when they are cured. They only return when they are suppressed. Can you think of an example of this within your life?

If you have struggled to become free, here is an understanding you should take. You are believing some delusion. That is the cause of your suffering. So make it your number one priority to search for the truth. Not to search for any guides or to ask for help. Search for understanding.

## "Nofap" Groups
These groups (not the organization) typically encourage the endless and mundane cycle that repeats for users trying to leave. Because they have a place to complain and loathe, they treat it like somewhere they can receive a reward/sympathy for failure, making failure seem less bad.

Being involved in these groups also causes users to have PMO on their minds more than others would ever have. This is not ideal for someone who wants total freedom because it requires no future discussions (there is nothing more to understand). Also, people that try to help others are commonly just failing to help themselves.

Stop announcing to others about what day you are on, when you finally become free, or your every thought and notice. Why? Because then you are reliant on others for your affirmation.

Freedom needs no day counter. Freedom needs no constant affirmation and ego battling - because that is what it is - freedom. Freedom needs no timeline. Freedom needs no suppression. These are the mistruths that have found their way into these communities through over-intellectualizing and over-mechanicalizing everything. Leave these circles, and become free.

## Identity
Identity is important when considering PMO.

When one identifies as a "PMO user" they subconsciously make decisions and act to align with that identity as much as possible.

We do this without noticing most of the time - we conform to what we feel we should be, even though we may want to change our current identity to someone else. When the identity shifts from a "PMO user" into somebody that does not need PMO, there is no such standard to align to.

One of my favorite examples is from James Clear:

> "Imagine two people resisting a cigarette. When offered a smoke, the first person says, “No thanks. I’m trying to quit.” It sounds like a reasonable response, but this person still believes they are a smoker who is trying to be something else. They are hoping their behavior will change while carrying around the same beliefs.
The second person declines by saying, “No thanks. I’m not a smoker.” It’s a small difference, but this statement signals a shift in identity."

When you stop trying to be something you are, you feel like you are swimming against a stream. This is why there must be an identity shift.

Imagine the person you want to be. Visualize this person. Now look at your current trajectory.

If you keep doing exactly what you are doing now (without change), will you become that person?

Some people semi-ironically identify themselves as "users" or "addicts" to cope with their own failures. You have to note that even though they may be partly joking, they will still align their actions with this identity. Otherwise, they wouldnt be an "addict" or "user".

## The Path Towards Peace
When self-improvement fails, work on discovering the truth. The search for peace is really the search for truth. Try to see the advantage of understanding things by discovering the truth rather than by practice.

When you discover the truth, bad habits can disappear with little effort through understanding.

Let’s say I’m trying to quit smoking. There are techniques I can try, but they’re commonly painful and difficult. Often, a moment will come when I see myself in a new way that allows the habit to disappear by itself. I get a diagnosis of lung cancer and understand I’m going to die, or I see a friend get in trouble with similar bad habits. When I see something clearly enough and understand it, the bad habit can dissolve by itself.

More broadly, I may see some facet of myself that I don’t like. Maybe I see it in a friend and then can’t unsee it to the point that we can no longer be friends.

Self-improvement is just a dressed up form of self-conflict.

**Seeing and understanding things leads to changes that practice and technique cannot achieve.** When you’re following a technique, there’s always a gap between you and the thing you’re trying to achieve. There’s always repetition, struggle and conflict. This is why those who chase guides often never find solutions - because they are not chasing understanding but the guides themselves.

If we want peace, we have to give up on self-conflict. We even have to give up on self-improvement, because self-improvement is just a dressed up form of self-conflict. Instead, we need to use our natural curiosity to understand things better. Through understanding, we will naturally improve ourselves.

As an example, once we truly understand the effects of unhealthy food on our bodies and rid ourselves of any delusions or mistruths  - we automatically change for the better. Once we look into all of our questions and confidently acknowledge the answer, we no longer need to struggle. This is the same for PMO.

The path towards peace is truth.

Truth-seeking essentially means that you have to understand, with deep conviction, things that you’ve been programmed to misunderstand. You have to have enough humility and sincerity to be able to replace old ideas with the new, however painful they may seem.

In this nature, you must acknowledge not only the truth and nature surrounding PMO but also the truth about your own mind. The truth about the struggle to leave. No rock should be left unturned. Through this, freedom will arise.

# Chapter 8. Neuroplasticity.md
Our true control of self comes from reactions. Our emotions are part of our nature, but what separates the trained mind from the untrained mind is that there is a conscious choice of response. Living as a direct result of emotion will not lead to freedom - understanding how we interact with emotions and how we can control them will do so instead.

Emotions are not "bad". The only thing that is "bad" is when we do not control emotions. Do not fall into the trap of classifying everything as good or bad. It is what we have learned to do - a lot of the time, we call things bad to appease our ego. Instead, observe what is more beneficial and follow that.

The mind should be a servant, not a master.

When I say you want to be happy, what I’m actually saying is you want to find peace. We say peace _of_ mind, but what we really want is peace from mind.

The mind goes quiet during the moments of greatest pleasure.

During your moments of greatest pleasure—whether you’re doing a drug, having an orgasm, finding your edge kite-surfing, laughing with a friend or looking at an incredible sunset—your mind goes quiet. It calms down, and that voice in your head goes silent. You achieve a sense of awe, which you might also call beauty, bliss or joy. We are seeking this peace from mind - this freedom.

We can only find this peace from mind if we are freed from our restrictions and addictions. We all seek this. We all chase it. Deep down, what we’re actually looking for is peace _from_ mind.

Primitive pleasures are just momentary glimpses of what peace feels like. Yet quickly, we are reeled back into the never-ending chase for that same glimpse. When we let go of these dependencies, the real peace we have been searching for will start to show.

Somewhere along the way, the mind became a master. I’m not making the mind out to be an enemy. It’s a very useful tool. But somewhere along the way, it became uncontrollable. The mind became the master rather than a servant. So it must be trained.

## Introspection
A significant quote from earlier on in the book:

>Any impulse of thought which is repeatedly passed onto the subconscious mind is, finally, accepted and acted upon by the subconscious mind, which proceeds to translate that impulse into its physical equivilent by the most practical method available.

Before continuing into this chapter, I want you to acknowledge something important. Do not prescriptionize anything here. Do not come to the conclusion that when bad thoughts come up, you have to follow some checklist to avoid a bad outcome. That is not what this is. There is no how-to here. All you need is an understanding for things to change, nothing more.

Also, when "look at the emotions" is said, this does not mean to be consumed by them. Somebody could say, "I have looked at my emotions, but nothing happened. I just felt worse". This is a misinterpretation.

When you observe yourself, it is wise to do so in a way where you simply acknowledge the emotion. Do not care if it is good or bad. The understanding is that you have control over reactions. Whether you realize it or not, every negative decision, every beneficial decision, is your choice. You have this ability to make decisions. Do not underestimate your power.

This is also what extreme ownership is about. It is easy to blame others. You can blame the porn industry. Blame the people that gave you bad advice. Blame your life circumstances. Blame your own brain. Blame the world. But all this blame will get you nowhere. You cannot change these external factors, so you must change internal factors. You must own the problem - even if it is "your fault" or not - to solve it.

An essential part of self-control is self-reflection. Mindfulness gives us an extra layer of introspection which we can use to control our reactions to emotion without automatically reacting negatively; the ability to recognize a problem and disassociate from the emotion, rather than being overpowered and pulled into negative thoughts and patterns.

Simply acknowledging a problem in our subconscious often causes it to dissolve. Instead of our automatic reactions, we will look for solutions instead.

Your conclusions and reactions to emotion dictate your ability to change your life into a more uplifting experience, so being in control of such responses is of great importance. This understanding is also the basis of stoicism (change the internal rather than external).

>Your reactions dictate your reality, and your reactions determine your mood. Your mood becomes your personality, and your personality determines your fate.

**What is mindfulness?** Mindfulness is the ability to control our reactions, the awareness of the processes in our brain and mind, and the awareness of our behavior and thinking patterns. This purposeful dive into our functioning allows us to move past roadblocks in our own life.

Mindfulness is not focusing on emotions. It is noticing those moments and taking control of the wheel.

**What is introspection?** Introspection is the reflective examination of one's own beliefs, behaviors or motives; the examination and observation of one's own mental and emotional processes. Introspection requires humility because new beliefs and truths will have to take the place of old ones.

Introspection should happen naturally. It is easy to prescriptionize introspection through dedicated times of thought. However, I understand introspection to be a subconscious effort that stems from a genuine interest. Introspection will happen after you become aware of your reactions, bad habits, and self.

When we have fear, anxiety, and other negative emotions, our minds have built up protection mechanisms to avoid losing self-worth. A significant part of this is that the rational and intellectual part of the brain drops activity - the focus is on our physical survival. This is why a proper, deep understanding of the situation is necessary to leave PMO.

Another reaction to these emotions is we enter into a defensive mode. Mainly, these reactions consist of the following: Dismissal (ignorance and lack of humility), Justification (excuses, tunnel vision and lying), Denial (taking offense, labeling enemy, projection) and Fear of the alternative (safe-zone, no action, false protection).

You do not have to memorize these reactions or anything like that. You only need to be aware of the general scope of defense mechanisms. While providing what we see as security, they only limit the path to finding truth and attaining freedom. Because in nature, every trait when a person goes into defense directly avoids the truth or possible alternative views. That is why having the humility to acknowledge that some of our views are unwise makes sense.

The last 'defense mechanism' I have not mentioned yet is the illusion of reward. This links to PMO the most because it is how we cling onto it and other similar patterns, even when we feel we understand how it does not benefit us.

One part of the illusion of reward is relief. When in the moment of experiencing emotion, the intellectual part of our brain shuts off, and we see things in a simplistic nature. Therefore, our authentic subconscious understandings will affect our actions.

 We have been trained to believe in relief - the idea that our detrimental actions may cause temporary relief.

We see this throughout society as a whole. People drink after a bad day; they use porn after splitting up with their partner, and they smoke when they get stressed. These detrimental habits and reactions propose themselves as reliefs - as something that can stop the negative emotion. However, what is clear to see from an outside perspective, is that all of these 'reliefs' are just momentary glimpses of peace. That is what all of these people are trying to get to. But the reality is that these negative 'reliefs' suppress problems. Mindfulness is helpful because identifying emotion allows us to understand these reliefs never provide freedom.

People drink for their entire lives, and they use porn or have many sex partners, to chase that glimpse of freedom and peace from their problems. However, none of these people will ever attain that freedom. This never-ending chase of these 'reliefs' will NEVER give you what you desire: peace. The only way to freedom from these problems is through understanding the truth of the problems; what they are. In this sense, if emotions cause issues, you must understand them in their nature. In that way, you can take control of the wheel.

Another aspect of defense mechanisms is postponing, or as commonly known, procrastination. In times when we hear a view contrary to our own, we do not want to face the challenging thing to defend our ego. This is what procrastination all ties into: self-worth. People with low self-worth and confidence rely on defense mechanisms more. In arguments that are less valid (and ones where these people are afraid to talk about them), these defense mechanisms are usually employed because they have low self-worth. People with high self-worth and confidence do not use these defense mechanisms as much. This is because even if they are wrong, they do not care - it is one step closer to finding the truth.

You may then say, "how do you become confident?". Any typical approach will lead to arrogance, which is easily detectable. True confidence comes from your self-worth. And self-worth comes from your ability to keep your own promises. In this sense, it may be wise to make fewer promises that you might not keep, and also, you may want to place a high amount of importance on fulfilling your promises, even in times of inconvenience.

Another part of the illusion of reward is attributing a positive expectation to a detrimental action. This, chemically, happens through dopamine. Dopamine acts as an anticipation chemical, not a pleasuring one, and if something gives a high amount of dopamine, it will seem more attractive no matter how much we understand it to be harmful. It is common for this positive expectation to exist for this detrimental action because otherwise, we will have to let go of the idea of any benefit.

We should understand that negative actions being seen as good is not what we really believe in, but it is just the effects of dopamine. This anticipation often makes people think about the action more and more. And a desire (tying in with the desire chapter) repeatedly passed to the subconscious actualizes itself in an impulse. If we do not want this impulse to happen, the nature of anticipation and the positive expectations of negative actions should be understood.

Some believe that emotions are destructive; they believe they should stop being emotional and that people (or women) are weak for being more emotional. This idea is toxic because it is trying to deny a part of human nature, and also, the person preaching this message is lying - their emotions still control them.

Emotions are just part of our nature. Yes, there are "good" and "bad" emotions, but emotions as a whole are neutral. They are a part of our human nature, which we should not demonize. We should not do this because trying to oppose part of our inherent nature is often unproductive. Instead of opposing emotions, we should instead think about our reactions to them. Having such a negative view of emotions also leads to fear. They fear that having some emotion is a bad sign or some sign of weakness; however, this is not the case. It is easy to fear emotions, but it is freeing to take control of the wheel and change your reaction to them.

> By attributing your suffering to schemas, and negative 
neurological pathways, instead of your true self, you gain a position of power. If you do this, however, you should still take full ownership of the problems - it is about changing your focus on solutions.

## The Advantage Of Neuroplasticity
We can use neuroplasticity to our advantage because thinking and believing positive thoughts will strengthen those pathways, which will mean we will think those thoughts more in the future.

Since birth, we have been actively building schemas about the world, others and ourselves. Norms, beliefs, habits, expectations, behavior patterns etc. That becomes our identity. In childhood, we often form beliefs about the world which are harmful and untrue due to our reactions to experiences in that time. The mind is like a computer in that you can input information, but unless it is processed to be valid, you will not know if what you believe in is based on truth or mistruth.

Finding negative schemas and moving past them through introspection can bring great satisfaction to those limited by harmful conclusions (made in the past). Our reactions rely heavily on our neural pathways and schemas, which are reinforced over time. Before this time, our actions were decided by elements outside our control, and our reactions were based on them. From this point, your future self does not have to be determined by your past self.

How can you become free from these negative thoughts and processes? Simply by acknowledging they exist. When you notice that you are in a negative thinking pattern, you can make the understanding that this acknowledgment creates new neural pathways, changing your state of mind and habits, and reinforcing a greater control. You can feel peace in this moment, knowing you are actively becoming the version of yourself you want to be.

Habits (and addictions to an extent) are just neural pathways that have been strengthened over time to become subconsciously automatic. They are the result of our schemas, and because we have thought of them so many times, it takes no conscious effort to think of them anymore. That is also why our lifestyle has to change so that PMO has no vacancy.

Old patterns influence us, but we can decide to take a different action, think different thoughts, and change the course of every event. If we become aware of the schema, we can stop ourselves from reacting impulsively to negative thoughts and states.

Our negative beliefs mascaraed as protection - they provide a false sense of security and reward. It functions as a barrier and protection against contrasting ideas that threaten our ego, effectively stopping us from looking for positive beliefs. This ties into what was previously said about defense mechanisms. This is why the premise of leaving their crutch is so uncomfortable for so many - because their destructive actions present themselves as beneficial.

**The ego's defensive mechanisms keep our beliefs in the same place as a means of 'protection' while having nothing to do with reality.**

Ego is not bad, but a tool we can utilize to be productive and advance ourselves. To do this, we must approach every argument and discussion with humility and sincerity. Otherwise, we will stay the same.

When we reinforce and think new thoughts more than previous ones, we strengthen the newer thoughts, and over time, the older pathways weaken, and they will stop making a difference.

Soon enough, our automatic reaction will no longer be harmful - the same situation no longer triggers the same mental pathway, and instead, we follow a positive reaction because we understand that identifying the moments where we can control our response helps us do so even more in the future, automatically.

This is the foundation for neuroplasticity. Over time (and with age), our beliefs become more static, and we challenge them less, causing them to become deeper routed as automatic processes, including negative and positive reactions. Even though such people commonly have less neuroplasticity than younger people, with enough new knowledge and desire to change, they can shift their mindset and neurological processes to have positive reactions. It is never too late to change, as we remain neuroplastic our whole life.

Catching ourselves in the middle of our negative reaction, and being self-aware, heavily changes our experience - it physically changes the brain and what schemas are triggered as reactions to events.

## Meditation (Mindfulness In The Right Brain)
You do not have to feel inclined to meditate just off of the following section. However, if you do so, you must re-organize your lifestyle to allow it to fit in. It should also be done if you have the intrinsic interest and enjoyment.

Meditation (in the way I see it) is a way to increase our awareness and mindfulness in the current moment. It allows a brief time for the mind to become silent, a rare occurrence. The most important part of meditation is noticing when you start to have thoughts - this can happen after some seconds into the thought, but when you realize that you are having these thoughts, you can return back to the present.

If you would like to do it, it is simple: turn on a timer for an allocated period of time (5-15 minutes or what you like) and go somewhere where you can find a relatively low noise level. If you cannot, wear earphones with no sound or something similar. Then, sit down (not laying down) with your back straight, and focus on some automatic process or sensation (such as touch, hearing, breath). No need to force these things, observe and let them naturally occur. 

When you spot that you have become distracted from your focus, return to the breath. Every time you realize you have become distracted, new pathways are formed in your mind that allow us to recognize thoughts and emotions more easily; this can help us control and react in ways we want to undesirable thoughts or emotions.

Mindfulness (right brain) is a useful practice alongside introspection (left brain), as logical and experiential processes go hand in hand to form the human experience. The end goal of mindfulness should be that it is no longer needed; it just happens automatically.

Again, you do not need to meditate, but if you want to do so, you can integrate it into your lifestyle.

## Fear
Focusing on fear leads to a negative focus. A negative focus leads to us imagining a worst-case scenario, which produces more of the same emotions. This self-feeding cycle is what builds up until people fail in whatever they are attempting. However, we now know we can control these reactions. When we feel fear and anxiety in such a manner, we rarely see the big picture, and so, we have a negative focus on events. We project our negative attention onto the future, imagining the worst-case scenario.

The thing is, these negative thoughts activate other negative mental pathways that are similar to them. These negative pathways cause us to fail in the very thing we are worrying about, in a very ironic sense. The person that is worrying and anxious about a job meeting is less likely to be successful than somebody that affirms confidence through self-trust and understanding.

When we are in a negative focus, we do not have access the immediate solutions to our problems, so we should not look for them. Instead, when we become aware of our reactions, we can be peaceful that we reinforce a new neurological pathway by acknowledging fear and controlling our response! Every time this happens over again, it will make it more automatic and natural, to the point where it becomes the new normal.

## Power
He or she is completely in control. Even when he or she wishes to lose control.

But without Freedom in all its glory, a person is broken.

To be imprisoned by the world is terrible.

To be imprisoned by the mind is to be left with nowhere to turn.

There is no greater tragedy in a human life than this.

When we are in 'reacting mode' due to fear, we try to solve the problem by focusing on the negative. It can cause us to have negative thoughts despite how truthful they are.

We can avoid these negative thoughts by becoming mindful of our emotions. We can be aware that we can create new neural pathways which replace the older ones we dislike. In the moment, if for some reason you are fearful, you can disassociate from the fear and realize that it is merely an automatic reaction, trying to keep you safe but failing to do so. Observing these emotions in a higher sense of self can redirect these thoughts to emphasize new pathways instead of following negative ones.

Do not follow some bullet-point checklist of things to do when you get a negative thought. That just ties into the previous section on prescriptions. Emotions are an experience, they are artistic, and they are not mechanical. With mechanical endeavors, prescriptions/how-to's work. The same operation provides the same result. But for creative and experiential endeavors, you must find the truth (the "cure") instead, through understanding, not routine.

In this state, we can make a big realization. In such a moment, **you** are creating pain for yourself by not paying attention to your schemas, and instead, letting the resulting emotions control your mind. It is easy to blame the mind, but you are in control of the mind. This is the reactive mode, which we have the power to stop. You have the ability *greater* than your schemas. No matter how bad the situation is, we always have the power to move into the observing mode, disassociating from our emotions and taking control of our reactions, disengaging from impulses.

> The problem does not lie in our true self because our true self realizes these problems. Our problems lie in our schemas. Do not make the mistake of believing you are powerless, as your schemas reinforce negative reactions, and you have control of those schemas.

By attributing the *cause* of suffering to these schemas, and negative neurological pathways, instead of your higher self, you gain a position of power, as you control these schemas also.

If you receive a negative thought, focus or reaction, it is due to your schemas. Realize that your adverse reactions are not your true being but a part of primitive nature. Attribute the problem to the schema, and observe. You can act greater, and you can take back control.

# Chapter 9. Transmutation.md
When no longer tied to the trap of PMO, your sexual energy will stop being as suppressed. Instead of harnessing the benefits of this energy, some people unknowingly fail to transmute the energy into creative and productive endeavours. This form of energy may be new to you because you may have never seen it.

Sexual desire is the most powerful of human desires. People who are driven by this desire—in a positive, constructive sense—can “channel” it to develop keenness of imagination, courage, willpower, persistence, and creative ability that are all but unknown at other times.

If you waste this energy on masturbation, you cannot harness this sexual energy, unable to transmute it into creative and physical goals.

The desire for sexual expression is inborn and natural. The desire cannot, and should not be submerged or eliminated. But it should be given an outlet through forms of expression which enrich the body, mind, and spirit of man. If not given this form of outlet, through transmutation, it will seek outlets through purely physical channels. It is easier to direct human nature, than to suppress or attempt to destroy it. This is also why sexual energy should NEVER be feared - because you can harness it to become a greater being.

When harnessed, and redirected along other lines, this motivating force maintains all of its attributes of keenness of imagination, courage, etc., which may be used as powerful creative forces in literature, art, or in any other profession or calling, even including the accumulation of wealth.

The emotion of sex contains the secret of high creative ability. Creative imagination is held within sexual energy because it is so powerful. Creativity is held within sexual energy when redirected into other channels because this energy can be transmuted, and this is where its value lies. The faculty of creative imagination is one which the majority of people never use during an entire lifetime, and if used at all, it usually happens by mere accident. 

Sexual energy also directly transmutes into physical energy. Sexual transmutation in professional boxers makes the difference between a winning fighter and a losing fighter. Sexual transmutation has been practiced intentionally by high level athletes for a very long time.

Transmuting sexual energy is not specifically to do with "nofap". Even people who do not MO or PMO usually do not have an understanding of the power of sexual energy so they do not harness or value it to where it is beneficial.

When lifted to this higher level of thought, through utilization of sexual energy, an individual occupies a higher level of vision and clarity than before. Moreover, while on this higher level of thought, the individual is not hampered or bound by any of the stimuli which circumscribe and limit his vision while wrestling with the problems of gaining the three basic necessities of food, clothing, and shelter. He is in a world of thought in which the ORDINARY, work-a-day thoughts have been as effectively removed as are the hills and valleys and other limitations of physical vision, when he rises in an airplane.

Sexual energy is what creates new life. It is the most powerful form of energy in nature.

Sex transmutation means the switching of one’s mind, or "dominating mental focus," from thoughts (and consequent actions) of a merely physical expression to thoughts (and consequent actions) of another nature. It does not mean in any sense "celibacy" or “repression of natural instincts." - It means approaching sex and engaging in sexual conduct from a completely positive, sincere, balanced and appropriate state of awareness.

Being in a sincere and positive relationship with a partner is beneficial because of the increase in creative imagination through positive sexual desire. A valued and uplifting partner will be of much benefit to you in whatever other life endeavours you partake in when sexual desire is harnessed purposefully when needed.

Sex energy is the creative energy which can differ a mediocre from a great. There never has been, and never will be a great leader, builder, or artist lacking in this driving force. However, the mere possession of this energy is not sufficient to be useful. The energy must be transmuted from desire for physical contact, into some other form of desire and action, before it will lift one to a higher level.

The emotion of sex is a virtue ONLY when used intelligently, and with discrimination. It may be misused, and often is, to such an extent that it debases, instead of enriches, both body and mind. Intemperance in sex habits is just as detrimental as intemperance in habits of drinking and eating. In this age in which we live, intemperance in habits of sex is common.

You can initialize this shift not through steps, but through desire.

> The road to higher ability consists of the development and control of sex, love, and romance.

## Partners
Memories of love never pass. They linger, guide, and influence long after the source of stimulation has faded. There is nothing new in this. Every person, who has been moved by GENUINE LOVE, knows that it leaves enduring traces upon the human heart. The effect of love endures, because love is spiritual in nature. The man who cannot be stimulated to great heights of achievement by love, is hopeless--he is dead, though he may seem to live.

Even the memories of love are sufficient to lift one to a higher plane of creative effort. The major force of love may spend itself and pass away, like a fire which has burned itself out, but it leaves behind indelible marks as evidence that it passed that way. Its departure often prepares the human heart for a still greater love.

If you believe yourself unfortunate, because you have "loved and lost," perish the thought. One who has loved truly, can never lose entirely. Love is whimsical and temperamental. Its nature is ephemeral, and transitory. It comes when it pleases, and goes away without warning. Accept and enjoy it while it remains, but spend no time worrying about its departure. Worry will never bring it back.

Dismiss, also, the thought that love never comes but once. Love may come and go, times without number, but there are no two love experiences which affect one in just the same way. There may be, and there usually is, one love experience which leaves a deeper imprint on the heart than all the others, but all love experiences are beneficial, except to the person who becomes resentful and cynical when love makes its departure.

There should be no disappointment over love, and there would be none if people understood the difference between the emotions of love and sex. The major difference is that love is spiritual, while sex is biological. No love experience, which touches the human heart with a spiritual force, can possibly be harmful, except through ignorance, or jealousy.

In reaction to breakups, something in your mind may view PMO as a way to cope. However, PMO is void of love. The beauty, the purity, and benefit of a true loving relationship is absent. Understand love in its ways and you have no need to cope with anything. The beauty of love is that it can be cherished and valued while experienced with a loved partner. When a partner is lost, use the sexual energy to transmute into other areas of your life, rather than wasting it on MO.

## Shifting Energy
You can take back the energy previously robbed from you - the same energy that flows through every cell in your body and the same energy that communicates with the ether. This energy on its own is nothing but potential. This potential must be harnessed to be helpful. Such energy creates a sense of depth in one's self. On the contrary, those without this aura appear with a lack of presence and depth. Energy is life; lacking it, you have been living less.

You must spend coins for them to be useful, and energy is the same. Coins, in a sense, are just another way of transferring energy, as is everything. This concept is not some abstract idea. This is just the nature of the life.

## What About My Anxiety?
Everyone has levels of anxiety - It is just you may view yours as some untreatable disease. When you do this, it becomes part of your identity; so you conform hoping someone will pity you.

You have to stop valuing outside opinion; realize it is worth little. Take other ideas into consideration, but make the final decisions. Do things for yourself. For YOU. Fuck the world and what the world thinks. You make the reality you live in. Place value in yourself - and when you abide by promises (to yourself) and you build up self-trust, confidence will come as naturally as bee to the nectar.

You create what corresponds to your identity. So remove negative thinking patterns from your identity, and you won't need to conform to them.

## Boredom
When a user becomes free, they are likely to have more time available. This is because #1 They have realized the emptiness and pointlessness of some of the previous activities. #2 They no longer need to browse through the material to try to get dopamine. #3 They develop a greater attraction to smaller but more fulfilling tasks.

This is time that has not been utilized previously - it is your decision what to do with your newfound time.

I believe a good idea is finding something fun or relaxing that you gravitate towards naturally. For more productive periods, I believe it may be beneficial to define something you love to do that is also productive. Having both something to do when you want to be focused and something to do when relaxing (that is not a carnal desire) may be of benefit to you.

In general, you should not aim to be perfect. Aim to be **better**. That is what matters. This does not mean you should not have high aspirations, but avoid comparing yourself to some "perfect" version of yourself that does not even exist.

When you fill in your time, it is wise to follow ideas outlined in this book that can also be applied to other goals. Make what you want to do the easiest option, and make what you don't want to do the least attractive option. 

## "Flatlines" & Wet Dreams
In the process of recovery, it is possible you may experience lowered spans of energy or higher ones. These "lows" people complain about is just the lack of energy they had before they quit. This is because of different components and neurochemicals in the brain, but this should not be feared. Waiting for whatever days you will get X amount of energy is futile. You can experience something greater - the joy and peace of freedom.

Another thing you may notice is you may start to have wet dreams. For those who do not know, they are basically dreams (often nonsensical) of a sexual nature, that naturally occur when not involved in sexual activites. They exist to clear your body out of dead sperm, to increase your fertility. The part about these dreams people find annoying however, is that the dreams they have bring back emotions that they used to have when they were in the trap.

The thing is, you should not have a negative outlook on these wet dreams. Previously, you were lowering your fertility rate through self-destruction; wet dreams are just a result of natural hormone activity. You should not build up a negative view on these dreams, and you should not look forward for them either (as it just acts as a substitute). Instead, when you have these dreams, understand them to be neutral. If you do not like the dream, you have the freedom within it to change what is going on (this might be on the edge of lucid dreaming).

It is wise not to view wet dreams negatively or positively. They are just a minor inconvenience that occurs naturally to keep your body in check.

## Substitutes
Sometimes, people who leave PMO are inclined to substitute PMO with other things/bad habits. This only happens due to fear - fear of losing dopamine. However, there is no need to replace dopamine. Let it be rephrased that dopamine does not really affect how much you enjoy things while doing them - dopamine is rather your anticipation towards events. Therefore, you do not need to chase any carnal desires to receive joy - you can enjoy the small things in life if you stop making excuses around them, and naturally, over time, you will feel a natural gravitation toward the smaller parts of life that give it meaning.

There is no need to replace PMO with anything. Freedom requires no substitutes.

## Power
When we identify negative thinking patterns in motion, we can realize that we are actively building up positive neural pathways that increase our ability to control and make less impulsive decisions.

When this is not done, you are creating pain for yourself by not paying attention to your schemas. Act *greater*, as we have the power and the ability to take the wheel of our reactions.

Instead of having fear around thoughts, we can develop a positive realization: we are building positive schemas!

Every time you observe, you notice, you understand, it builds new schemas and mental connections in your mind that will positively affect your ability to do those very things in the future. This is not done through routine after reaction, but through understanding.

## Curiosity Questions
Some of you may not understand why curiosity questions are unproductive. As hey, it is natural for us to ask questions about things to increase our intelligence (and this is how we learn new things). So what is the problem here?

I am talking about questions (about a process) that have no real purpose except for shifting emotions. Questions relating to when things are happening, how much of something will change, how many benefits will happen, how long you have to wait, is this a bad sign, etc.

These types of questions serve no real purpose except for increasing anticipation or anxiety. Some may say that anticipation and anxiety are the same emotion, but with a positive or negative connotation attached. The issue with these questions is that they make us worry for little reason except our curiosity.

It is in our nature to wait for things, to constantly ask when a parcel is coming, to ask how long some process will take. The reality of these questions is that the events will stay the same no matter how many of them you ask.

In relation to PMO, you may want to ask these questions because you are anticipating something positive, or you may ask these questions, becoming anxious if you believe something is a bad sign.

You have to realize that the only change these curiosity questions will make will be an undesirable and unproductive outcome - the emotions will feed right back into the neural pathways of PMO.

True peace and freedom lies in the understanding that you do not have to ask such questions as soon as the process is underway. You do not have to wait for freedom. You do not have to wait for peace. You should feel no need to ask such questions because the process is underway, and freedom is already yours. Freedom happens at a point where a process is understood in its entirety.

In a sense, the process is similar to a plant. When you stare at a plant, you will never see any change. To the eye, it stays the same. However, when you return the next day, it will have grown a little more. Yet, there is no need to compulsively ask when our plant will grow more. We can find peace in knowing that it will always grow.

## Reminders
At certain times you will be reminded about PMO. Through social media, random thoughtsz, when you may be bored and so on.

Some people really dislike the thought of this. They begin to fear the worst like it is some sort of bad sign that they are going to fail soon. Again, this is the trap of classifying things as good and bad.

When reminders occur naturally, it presents an opportunity. It is a moment in time where peace and freedom can be acknowledged. Over time, the old pathways will weaken, and your new natural will be peace. However, there is no reason to wait for anything. You can experience freedom in motion at all times.

Internal reminders are just remnants of the previous lifestyle that accounted for PMO. These are simply associations we made that incited us in the past to go on the chase for that glimpse of freedom but never being able to reach it. Peace comes when you realize the chase has ended.

Of course, you do not want to set up reminders intentionally. This ties into the lifestyle change that was talked about earlier. You may want to unfollow some social media pages, leave some communities with a negative influence, and even change where you take your phone and things like that. Do not feel forced to do any of these things; however, it would be of much benefit to change such lifestyle activities, as PMO no longer has a place in the picture.

There are also some key places/services who consciously promote lewd content which should be avoided. Services such as tiktok, instagram and others have algorithms that purposefully promote this lewd content to keep user attention. On tiktok, it is so blatant, yet not contested by those who it appears to in their "feed". Leaving these platforms is another deal, but it should be considered to remove these apps from your life and to move to better things. These platforms, on top of lewd content promotion, have a whole host of other negatives that they use to keep users, so regulation and removal of these services should be considered. However, you must acknowledge you need a lifestyle change to where they no longer fit in as much (or at all) to any part of your life.

## Momentum
You have to start taking life more seriously.

Imagine what changes you would make to your life if you knew you were going to die in a year. You would change habits, do things you always thought you couldn't and you would consciously move towards the things you want to do before your time is up. However, our reality is, we only have one life. No minute can be taken back. Thousands of hours of mediocre gaming can never be replaced. Thousands of hours scrolling through tiktok can never be replaced. And this is not a depressing thought - because the beauty of life is that it blossoms and fades away. However - you must realize that nearly nobody takes life seriously.

In jobs, education and the like, people place a large importance in going through. It has been pushed to them by society, family and friends that it is what they need to do to be happy. Yet, in personal goals, people place a lesser importance on them.

Even though these personal goals will make more of an impact than anybody else's desires, they are done less because we do not place an importance on them.

To make changes in your life, you must start taking it seriously.

# Chapter 10. Moving On.md
We are told by society to help everybody. To be virtuous, to want to help everybody and to change the world. The truth is, a majority of people with this desire do not realize that it is because they fail to help themselves.

It is easier to look at somebody else's problems and to tell them what to do. You ask people how to get rich, and most can give advice, but they have excuses for why they do not put their own advice into action or why it has not worked.

Virtue to others can be a form of self-neglect. The belief that being selfless results in more general positivity is a fallacy. If you fail to love yourself and to value your own life, you cannot do a good job of supporting others around you.

For your life to move on, you cannot be stuck in the past. You cannot be living a lifestyle where your old bad habits still have a vacant slot which is ready to be filled at the next impulse.

Communities can cause problems (such as "nofap"), especially for PMO. With the existance of a community creates the need for people to return to it. And when people return to it, they can never let go. When they start to get more involved and as anti-PMO communities become part of their life, so does PMO itself.

Most people that try to give you advice are stuck in the past, because they have not moved on.

Community also provides a place where people can mope to. Where they can complain, and ask question on question in an endless cycle of self neglagence. You may have full clarity in the moment when a cue or lewd video occurs. Yet, through all that, if you involve yourself in these communities, you have somewhere to complain about it to, to get sympathy.

No matter how much sympathy and motivation you recieve, if you see it as a way to make relapses less bad, they will play no part in your freedom.

I am not saying movements towards helping people is bad. However, what I see occur is that people (who know all that needs to be known) are only "users" because they are stuck in the past.

As an example, the result of you reading this book may be exciting. It will be life changing, when read with humility. The result of this is you may message people about it. You may start talking to others advising them using this material. Repackaging and reformatting the ideas here.

THIS IS THE SECOND TRAP.

The second trap is leaving PMO itself.

Let go of these communities and groups. Let go of trying to help everybody else. Because to truly move on, you need to prioritize yourself.

## Help Out The Book, And Never Again
If you have the feeling ppmo would benefit someone, send them a message right now. Do not say "you should read" but say about the effect it had on you.

> Book link: https://ppmo.vercel.app

If you involve yourself in communties where you think this book would be beneficial, mention others or post a link to this book if you want to promote it. If there is somebody you think would benefit, mention them before leaving the communities. Say your goodbyes.

Also if you are the type to make memes, you can create one quickly.

**Get this out of the way now.**

When you have given advice to all the people you want to, return here.

## Letting Go Of "Anti-PMO" Communities
After this step, remove yourself from all servers, subreddits, communities related to "nofap". If you are in a discord server with channel/s based around it, you can mute the channel/s and then choose the server option to hide muted channels.

The second trap is the attachment to those on the same journey. However, as long as you have that mutual goal with others, you will never be free. You have to make that decision to move ahead and prioritize your own wellbeing.

On another note, when people leave the PMO trap, they tend to announce that they are quitting like they have a loudspeaker. From my experience, those that stay quiet the most, are chilling the most. Keep this in mind.

THIS STEP IS OF A LARGE IMPORTANCE.

People act as some exception to this. However, unless you want to be stuck in the trap due to being stuck in the past, you must look out for yourself. When a community is based around a common goal, and you no longer have that goal, you will subconsciously go back to PMO (to regain the same goal), if you continue to be active within such a community.

This is why the step for promo exists - so then the word can still spread, but then you can move past everything to do with PMO.

## Letting Go Of Cue-Filled Media
Services/sites like 4chan, tiktok, reddit, meme groups, instagram, and much more are ridden with suggestive cues and lewd content for a reason; to keep users browsing - to users of all ages this is. They promote suggestive content to kids, knowingly getting them hooked for life with no concern for their wellbeing or health.

This is another issue completely, with the abundance and reliance on social media in the modern age. Generally, leaving these things requires a phase out of the need for using them. Do not try to make a huge change in these things based on motivation. Instead, think about what you enjoy more than these media sites, but which is also more beneficial.

As we have also said before, cues are not bad - but surrounding your environment with them will place them on the forefront of your mind. If we do not seek them, cues are opportunities for new neural pathways to be built in our subconscious, reforming our mind into more positive thinking patterns by the day. You can find joy in these moments, because you are free. Security can be found in realizing you have this control, when not giving it up.

# Chapter 11. Freedom.md
First of all, I highly appreciate your sincerity to read to this point.

If you have used P/MO while reading to this point, it is of no concern. Because through an understanding of the reality of everything encompassing PMO, you will no longer have to believe that PMO is negative. Because the truth leads instead.

Decisions that are based in truth aren't really made again. If I make the decision that I do not want to get eaten by a shark once, I do not have to make that again. If I make the decision that I should not swim because I believe it to be dangerous, then that is a decision not based in truth (because it is an incredibly rare occurance). I hope you see the point I am making here. You do not need to make decisions that are based in truth again.

You can look back to such decisions in the future, and can dissect them. Yet, their integrity stands. Because when the truth is known, acting the opposite is only ignorance, and you cannot act in ignorance to reach a higher fufillment.

At this moment, consider everything you have learnt. Be sincere and true for the following.

Ask yourself these questions:

- Is porn beneficial to me?

- Are sexual activities without sincere love to a partner beneficial to me?

In knowing both of these statements to be false, without lying to yourself, in true sincerity, continue.

Say this in your head, in faith and true sincerity:

"From this day, I will not allow myself to remain using porn and masturbation because I understand them to be not beneficial.
 Instead, I will seek sincere and pure relationships, and I will harness my sexual energy to reach a higher level of fulfilment and success in my life."

From now onwards, you no longer have to partake in the endless chase towards temporary freedom. Instead, you can experience what you have always been searching for - true freedom.

You no longer have to fear reminders, because they are just remenants of the past, and observing them, without fear, provides power and control.

Do not wait for benefit, because you can experience it in this moment - you are free.

## Focus Shift
Do not wait for anything. Focus is important.

Focus on the person you want to become. If your current trajectory does not encourage becoming that person, change your trajectory so that you will become that person.

There are many other facets in life other than PMO. Are you getting quality sleep? Is your environment directing you to become a better person?

Place your time and efforts on this visualization process. Become the person you want to be, through each of your actions.

It is easy to get stuck in the past when we either wait for something to happen or we ignore other things in our life except for PMO. Realistically, there is a lot more to it.

> Note: Atomic Habits (James Clear) provided me personal insight into the process of habits and the best ways to integrate habits into your life, and it may be useful to you. After breaking bad patterns, the next step is building good ones. Btw I find the "Identity", "Cues" and "Attractivness" parts of the book most useful ;)

With an inclination, and belief in a desire, you can achieve anything. Go and get it. I Love you all. Btw do not underestimate books.

"Truth lies not in Teaching,
But in the desire to learn. 
Truth lies not in learning information,
But in learning The Truth.

Learning The Truth
Lies in a consistent exposure to a Source of Truth.
A consistent exposure to a Source of Truth
Arises from a longing for Truth." - Kapil
