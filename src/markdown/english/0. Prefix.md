## Important Note

Regardless of what you have read previously, read every word with humility.

Compare the words to your real life experiences. Challenge them. You can use no formula or list of steps to become free, but instead must seek understanding, and find it within yourself.

**The goal should be to seek truth.**

Do not believe the words that follow in this book. Instead, search for the truth within them.

Blind belief does not encourage freedom. Because belief is subjective. Truth is universal. To attain truth, you must seek it.

**It is important that you change your focus from methods and guides to understanding truth.**

With that said, my heart goes out to all of you.

I hope this book will change your life.
