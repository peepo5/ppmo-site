First of all, I highly appreciate your sincerity to read to this point.

If you have used P/MO while reading to this point, it is of no concern. Because through an understanding of the reality of everything encompassing PMO, you will no longer have to believe that PMO is negative. Because the truth leads instead.

Decisions that are based in truth aren't really made again. If I make the decision that I do not want to get eaten by a shark once, I do not have to make that again. If I make the decision that I should not swim because I believe it to be dangerous, then that is a decision not based in truth (because it is an incredibly rare occurance). I hope you see the point I am making here. You do not need to make decisions that are based in truth again.

You can look back to such decisions in the future, and can dissect them. Yet, their integrity stands. Because when the truth is known, acting the opposite is only ignorance, and you cannot act in ignorance to reach a higher fufillment.

At this moment, consider everything you have learnt. Be sincere and true for the following.

Ask yourself these questions:

- Is porn beneficial to me?

- Are sexual activities without sincere love to a partner beneficial to me?

In knowing both of these statements to be false, without lying to yourself, in true sincerity, continue.

Say this in your head, in faith and true sincerity:

"From this day, I will not allow myself to remain using porn and masturbation because I understand them to be not beneficial.
 Instead, I will seek sincere and pure relationships, and I will harness my sexual energy to reach a higher level of fulfilment and success in my life."

From now onwards, you no longer have to partake in the endless chase towards temporary freedom. Instead, you can experience what you have always been searching for - true freedom.

You no longer have to fear reminders, because they are just remenants of the past, and observing them, without fear, provides power and control.

Do not wait for benefit, because you can experience it in this moment - you are free.

## Focus Shift
Do not wait for anything. Focus is important.

Focus on the person you want to become. If your current trajectory does not encourage becoming that person, change your trajectory so that you will become that person.

There are many other facets in life other than PMO. Are you getting quality sleep? Is your environment directing you to become a better person?

Place your time and efforts on this visualization process. Become the person you want to be, through each of your actions.

It is easy to get stuck in the past when we either wait for something to happen or we ignore other things in our life except for PMO. Realistically, there is a lot more to it.

> Note: Atomic Habits (James Clear) provided me personal insight into the process of habits and the best ways to integrate habits into your life, and it may be useful to you. After breaking bad patterns, the next step is building good ones. Btw I find the "Identity", "Cues" and "Attractivness" parts of the book most useful ;)

"Truth lies not in Teaching,
But in the desire to learn. 
Truth lies not in learning information,
But in learning The Truth.

Learning The Truth
Lies in a consistent exposure to a Source of Truth.
A consistent exposure to a Source of Truth
Arises from a longing for Truth." - Kapil Gupta MD
