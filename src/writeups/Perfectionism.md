Perfectionism is a trap that is rarely talked about..

It is engrained into many facets of our lives. Our projects, our relationships, and our beliefs.

What we do not realize is that perfection is a moving goalpost.

Perfection does not exist. It is just the idea of "There is always better"/"The best". This way of thinking is not genuine because who determines perfection?

Is perfection "Good" or "Bad"? It must be "Good", because it is what we are always chasing.

Perfection is a lie - if every time you reach "perfect", there is another place to reach, then "perfect" is not true.

Perfectionism is the lie that there is always something better that you need - and therefore you should always feel like you have something missing.

In reality, perfection does not exist. And if it did, it would destroy all art and beauty.

What does the perfect face look like? It is subjective. But then you may say there are many perfect faces. But how does that make sense - only one perfect could exist.

People have popularized rating partners with a single number -- you take a quick glance at someone and you rate them on an arbitrary scale of perfection. For those you deem to be on the bottom of this arbitrary scale, these people are demeaned. For those on the top, they are loathed for like some once-in-a-lifetime prize. But in reality these people are all the same; humans.

And then for those in relationships who use this same rating. If they do not rate their partner a "10" (which is all the time) then they imply there is always something better out there. And some may say "I am just being honest when rating people" but perfectionism lives at the core of rating people like this. Keep this in mind.

And then there is perfectionism in art. If you are not willing to make imperfect action, you will take no action. This is also why perfectionism lies at the heart of procrastination.

If we always visualize our "perfect" image of ourselves to be this fully-motivated and sensible person, then we see a dissonance between our ideal selves and our current selves - leading to the pain of knowing you are not what you want to be.

If you always have an idea of "perfect", and you are not peaceful with where you are now, then you will never be peaceful. The goalpost will move and you will continue chasing forever.

So does this mean visualizing your future self is bad? No. Even perfectionism is not bad. It is just unproductive and inefficient.

Having goals is great, but you must realize that you can never become someone in the future. You can only become something in the present moment. The present moment is all you have, not the past or the future.

For efficient growth, the aim is becoming better and more efficient in every way possible, rather than comparing your current "imperfect" self to your visualized "perfect" self and feeling down about it.

If you need to become someone to be satisfied, then you will never be satisfied. We always think of what we want as an end result but never how we will create the process to get there. How can we become better in every moment?

It is strange to realize that we rarely think about the process to get to our "ideal selves" but we spend 99% of our time dreaming about what we could be.

When the aim shifts from trying to become your "perfect self", to becoming better bit by bit in the present moment (which you have), then a lot less time is wasted.

When you stop believing you need to be a professional to start everything, but instead realize you know nothing and that is alright, then you can grow.

You evolve as a being through daily positive growth, not becoming "perfect". Is there any benefit to feeling glum knowing you are not perfect, compared to feeling joyful about growing in every moment to be better? You can decide that.

Perfectionism also poisons "self-improvement". If you are trying to improve towards a moving goalpost, and you frame it in a perfectionist view (like "I am not good enough right now") then you will not be appreciating towards your actual progress, and you will never be good enough.

In the end, perfectionism is something to be aware of. It is the ultimate cause of procrastination. But it is also not bad - just not productive.

Myself, I am not perfect either.

I know nothing.

Adios.
