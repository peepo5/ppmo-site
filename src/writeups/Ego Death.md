The ego is a tool.

Your ego is not your enemy, but your ego is not your friend either. Then what is your ego?

Your ego is what you believe your "Self" is. What your "I" is. Ego is what seperates "Me" from "You". It builds up our perspective of reality.

The ego acts as our protector against vulnerability but also our blinder against humility.

The ego counts your promises as your word and ultimately your ability to keep promises end up as your confidence.

Your ego places self-value in where you see true value (through others' opinions or your intrinsic value).

It therefore is an important part of human nature, and in the spirit of all human nature, remains neutral; not bad or good. The problem with ego is that most people have it completely untrained. When the ego is untrained, it puts a blinder on your viewpoint, removing humility, sincerity, and similar attributes needed for evolution and growth as a being. Without humility, you will stay in the same place, and it will eventually become very painful (Depression comes from lack of growth).

The first step is seperating what you identify as your "Self" from the ego and the other emotional states of your mind. You are a being with many seemingly disconnected parts, yet they are all incredibly connected. The true "Self" does not come from impulsive nature, unless you identify your impulsive and animalistic nature as "You". This is a critical mistake. You exist above the basic levels of the mind, as even through moments where you feel you are out of control, you still seem to be able to observe yourself like you are watching someone make mistakes without being able to change a thing.

You exist above human the human body and its animalistic and impulsive ways. No matter what you believe, this is the truth; humans have always seeked something greater than survival.

"Good" and "Bad" are fruits of the ego. By saying that something is good and something is bad, it is implying that you know what is right and you have the right viewpoint. Your viewpoint may be the most logical and well-thought viewpoint out there, but when the ego gets involved, it starts to close you down to humility and it makes you feel like you are the superior person.

Another trouble when "Good" and "Bad" are attached to things, vibrations and thoughts, is that emotions get involved. When "Bad" comes around, anger, discomfort, tenseness and sadness become more pronounced. When "Good" appears then you have periods of happiness, relaxation, anticipation and comfort. Therefore, if your particular perspective of most things is "Bad", what thoughts do you think will be produced?

On top of this, when emotions come into the equasion, it shuts of your logical thinking brain. This does not happen when something is inspected truly neutrally, but this is practiced so little that not many would know how such a thing would be possible. It is possible through the act of dissasociating "Good" and "Bad" from thoughts. One objective way to look at things is "Constructive" or "Destructive" energy. And even these are not good or bad.

The more you deconstruct things away from emotion, you realise that destruction is needed for construction. Death is needed for life. You come out of the ground, and must once again become that same ground.

When you strip things to their basic nature - describing things in the most obvious but plain way possible - aiming to remove preconceptions, judgement and your idea of "knowing" then you shall see these things in a nature of clarity unseen before.

The fruit of deconstructing thoughts and things is not an emotionless and out-of-touch person, but completely the opposite; a compassionate, relatable being whose idea of existance elevates onto a whole new plane. Someone that can see through the smoke into true clarity.

But then, there is a snag to these ideas. Even as I say these things, the ego presents itself in a sneaky manner. This is the idea that "I know this".

You know nothing. Remember this.

If you knew everything, you would have no reason to grow. And lack of growth would not cause you pain. Is your ego blinding you in this way?

For those that feel like they have their arms and legs stuck in a trap to forever be a slave to their carnal bodily desires, you are making the fallacious assumption that your body is "You". You exist as a spectator, above all of these basic and animalistic levels. These lower levels of consciousness are not "Bad", but part of a cohesive system for growth (but growth is hard in this age of information and manipulation).

To where pain becomes real enough for the idea of life itself not continuting to seem good, you know how much you value your ability to follow your higher purpose. This is the pain of a lack of growth. When growth stops, pain starts. Therefore, if humility is not present, all that is present is ignorance; the ultimate path to dissatisfaction. If you have ever come to such a point like this in life, or you are in a place like this in life, it is a springboard.

Pain is not "Bad".

Pain creates beauty; it creates art, creativity, purpose. It creates progress, it changes ideas.

Do not waste time coddling yourself while you lack growth. Pain creates a strange kind of comfort, but it does not lead to resolve. It leads only to more of itself.

Pain can be used to train the ego. The constructive use of the ego is how often you can follow-through with promises (also called "confidence"). But first, a state of vulnerability should be opened, as the destructive ego can become so engrained that it becomes unnoticed. The ego is also often what causes endless questions; because of an engrained lack of humility.

Many natural resources and medicines can save time in deconstructing the ego and creating vulnerability. Psilocybin (from "shrooms") is one such natural medicine that can create this state of vulnerability in which you can fundementally rearrange your paradigm without the interference of an ego for a short amount of time (with lasting positive effects). Vulnerability requires opening up walls we previously deployed to "keep ourselves safe", however these same walls harm us just as much as they protect.

Natural medicine like such can provide vulnerability and neuroplasticity in a shorter amount of time than usually needed - and this is where there incredible value lies. Such things are one of our many gifts.

To truly grow, you must understand that you are a summerization of your beliefs so far. A lot of these beliefs are illogical, ignorant, and ineffective. And a lot of truths are misunderstood or unknown. Some of these beliefs are so fundemental that it seems stupid to put these into question - but this must be done to evolve.

While "Good" and "Bad" are fruits of the ego, it is no excuse to live, again, for your carnal desires. One with humility and deep thought understands that energy given out is recieved back, directly or indirectly. Therefore, being someone constructive rather than destructive helps yourself and others. Yes, sometimes you have to put yourself first, and you should. You cannot be perfect, but you can aim to be better, so do so.

The words in this writeup may seem vague and complex, but my words are sincere. My heart goes out to all of you. When you enter the state of vulnerability, new stages of growth can be reached.

Adios.
