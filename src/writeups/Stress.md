Stress is not to do with your life circumstances. Stress is to do with your view on life circumstances.

If negative things happen in your life, it does not create stress. Your view creates the stress. __You__ can leverage and [transmute](https://www.wordnik.com/words/transmute) negativity - not through a how-to's but through expression and creativity.

Stress is trying to be in two places at once. Like a bar which is being bent on both ends, with the stress being created in the middle.

Stress is never necessary. It has no use except for taking years off your life in double digits, and disturbing peace.

Stress can often come about due to lack of priority. You cannot place everything on the same priority. You also should not put so much on your plate that your responsibilities create the need to juggle them around in importance.

You can never use stress as an excuse for your own wrongdoing, because you directly control it. It is never an excuse to be a negative influence on those around you and the world.

If stress is the result of being overwhelmed, you must brutally judge priorities. What you prioritize in your mind will recieve more energy than what you place as a lower importance.

Stress is a result of not directing your energy properly. What you direct your energy towards most, will have the most potential. But if you try to put your energy into every place, everything will recieve the same little amount of energy, and it will be unproductive.

If you want to do more at the same time without getting overwhelmed, your focus should be on increasing your energy (life energy/"vibration") rather than trying to mitigate stress and coping.

The [ego](/writeup/ego_death) can be a useful tool to increase your energy.

Referaming your view on stress on its own can do wonders.

Adios.
