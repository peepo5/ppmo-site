Sleep sets the entire mood for your day. More than that, it controls the person you turn out to be, it changes your interactions with others, and it impacts your productivity. I could go on about how important it is, but that does not make much difference in who gets out of bed.

For those that struggle to wake up for tomorrow's day - remember that all of nature will wake up before you. The bees, the butterflies, the beetles. The flowers will open for the sunlight, and the sun will show it's face. The ego says you are above these all, yet, they are up and ready before you.

There are those that try to postpone tomorrow; today blends into tomorrow as the two become an interlinked mess - yet will this short-sightedness help you? The ultimate act of ignorance is not realising you are being ignorant. Tomorrow will come around whether you are ready for it or not. However, it is in your ability to dictate how that day will go forward; how in that day you can grow and evolve. And to do so, you must be up in accordance with the rest of nature.

If you want to postpone tomorrow because you do not like today, you have to realize that you have the power to change today... which will change tomorrow.

If you want to let the wild wind of fate blow you about at the wisp of every occurance, like most, you can let that happen. However, it is not an effective way to get to your goals, and to ultimately be peaceful.

An evening and a morning both go hand in hand, and for a quality rest, both should be in check. But what is your default? Is your default staying up until your eyes hurt or you feel sleepy? Or maybe you have a set time you go to bed. Or is your default creative expression at late hours, like me ;) ?

To change your "default" an environmental trigger is the most easy option to know when to end and start the day. By making two concrete points of action, you can build your entire day around these points. Let me explain.

Without a solid habit/repeated action to rely on, any new routine relies solely on unreliable events or specific timings. And these things do not help you create a reliable routine.

So what will? You will need an enjoyable and consistent action at these times. It can incredibly simple. The only bit where you need some mental effort is initially implementing these actions (but if they are enjoyable you will do them).

For example, at 9PM at evenings you can make a herbal chamomile/lavender tea. Make it the most delicious and calming tea ever. Just this cue alone will settle you for sleep. When you wake up, you can have a similar cue (like a nice coffee 90 mins after you wake up) and these two events (in this case, drinks) act as rocks to build your other day events on. You want to make these things low on dependencies (like tea and coffee does not cost that much) because otherwise environmental changes can throw your whole routine off.

This may seem like it is more a writeup to do with routine, but sleep does lie at the heart of routine so it is worthy to write about. Take care of your body and mind, and do not let yourself fall unmaintained. If you think nobody cares, I do. My heart reaches out to you all.

Quick tip; Best supplements for sleep (these do not fix bad sleep timings):
- Magnesium
- Glycine
- Melatonin
- L-Theanine
- Creatine

You can also lower blue light with a night time filter (like flux) or by using (legit) blue light glasses. However, these recommendations do not compare to actually improving your sleep itself. It will pay off.

Anyways, it is 12 at night when writing this... life is full of irony. However, expression can bend the rules. Is the excuse worth it? Anyways have a good night.

zzzzzzzz

Adios.
