The mentor has it the hardest.

If the mentor does not understand something, who teaches the mentor? Mentors feel like they know everything, but they struggle the most. They fail more than the student.

Then, due to this, they have to put up an image of perfection and if they do not put up this image, it will discourage students.

The mentor has a lack of outside opinion on ideas because they have to be creators of the ideas. Therefore, they have to think thoughts no man has thought before. They can ask their students but their students may also be a reflection of them.

Mentors cannot create legends. Instead, mentors are legends, or legends don't have mentors. You cannot mentor a legend into existance. The one with the most success makes their own path, and do not have one layed before them. They have to walk in the dark, and most are not willing to take this risk.
